"28579615","You don’t need to put the word “scientists” in quotes. There does exist a large number of highly qualified and credentialed scientists that have worked in molecular biology and agroscience for their entire careers. Molecular biology is very well-established -- to the point that a majority of genetic engineering has been reduced to practice through the use of off-the-shelf pre-prepared kits, and been scaled up using robotics.One need not “entertain the notion that GMOs are safe” - to the extent that it is possible to prove anything safe, GMOs are as safe as any other existing technology and GMO foods, as safe as non-GMO foods. Hundreds of thousands of man-hours of study, many by people focused specifically on undermining the claim of safety, have been poured into studies and are all available for you to review at your convenience online, or at a university near you. It would be disingenuous to suggest that GMOs pose any threat to human health. Issues related to the environment are also well-studied — and there are issues, but not substantially different than unnatural act of agriculture itself.Hybridization is only one method of plant genetic modification, and has only been intentionally used for the last 100 years or so. Prior to that, most plant genetics were affected by a combination of natural and artificial selection. The 1940’s and 1950’s brought us chemical and radiation mutagenesis, which we combined with selection. It wasn’t until the 1990’s that genetic manipulation of germplasm was used to produce a plant with a novel gene (in that case, an antisense gene; one from the plant that was inserted backwards to reduce expression of the sense gene). In the subsequent 25 years, much of genetic engineering has been reduced to practice, the materials and methods have been commoditized. There’s a lab in the building next to the one where I’m standing where they have labs that teach middle-schoolers how to do DNA extractions, perform sequencing experiments, and splice genes into microorganisms. I’ve done plant DNA extractions at home with my kids just using stuff from around the house.Genetic engineering has not, however, replaced breeding and hybridization. Companies like Monsanto, for example, are foremost breeders of traditional hybrid crops. The GMO traits they provide are optional value-added products. This is not “farming done in a laboratory” - farming is still predominantly horticulture.I think it’s paranoid to believe that companies have no regard for the safety of the public. They are subject to governmental regulatory oversight, must meet various standards, have an obligation for reporting adverse events, and have broad civil liability for the safety of their products. Harm would jeopardize their business and bottom-line.It is true that people that disregard science and are fearful of GMO food will purchase food that they feel is not GMO. Objective evidence is notoriously ineffective at swaying strongly held religious belief.To answer your question, however, … GMO crops in rich economies like those of North America primarily have benefit to the producers, where the crops have higher yields and allow the use of less pesticide (which are expensive, as is their application). The environment and neighbors to farms benefit indirectly from reduced and less harmful chemical run-off. Outside of the less well-off economies, GMO traits can lower risk of crop-failure in marginal climates, address soil quality issues, and increase per-acre yield where demand is high and arable land is at a premium. In areas with poor nutrition, the addition of traits that supplement vitamins and other nutrients can dramatically improve public health. In a number of cases, some crops have been at risk of being wiped out by blights and have been brought back through introduction of genes that confer resistance.","2016-09-30T18:07:11.958Z","QW5zd2VyQDA6Mjg1Nzk2MTU=","false","McInnes","James","28","3985","https://www.quora.com/profile/James-McInnes-1","2973986","5288347","https://www.quora.com/For-those-who-support-GMO-can-anyone-explain-why-people-should-choose-GMO-over-non-GMO-foods/answer/James-McInnes-1"

These are all just tools and technologies that can be applied in both good or bad ways. Stop focusing on the screwdriver. Start focusing on what people are *doing* with the screwdriver…Likewise, one would have to be a real Luddite to call oneself “anti-electricity” - or be very poorly informed about what electricity is and all the many positive ways it can be used. Same goes for “anti-GMO”. This is also why so many scientists object to labeling foods as GMO or GMO-free: it’s essentially a meaningless label because it carries zero information about *what* modification was made to the food. Might as well label food as “made with electricity”, or “contains no chemicals” (fact check: *everything* is made out of chemicals).For the current commercial GMO crops, there are essentially no health reasons to choose in favor or against GMO crops just because they are GMO. There are definitely some strong environmental and agro-political reasons to choose crops that have been grown in ways that reduce the use of dangerous chemicals, or crops grown by local family farms vs a giant industrial agrocomplex, or heirloom varieties vs monocultures, or to eat lower on the food chain; but those are not issues that are specific to the GMO vs non-GMO debate.

I don\u2019t however support many of the unwise uses it has been put.There are a few I would certainly support and the most obvious would be any GMO designed to resist a plague that would exterminate that food source to begin with. So for example, soon we will have GMO American Chestnuts.

"76688280","Foods? You seem to forget that before something becomes a “food,” someone has to grow it.The people who buy GMOs aren’t the people who buy foods. They are the farmers who are living hand to mouth, and for whom even a few dollars saved a month from reduced pesticide costs or a few dollars gained through better yields can mean the difference between sending your child to school or not.You, the consumer, are not the target. The farmer is. And it is very unfortunate that you, with your wealth and privilege, get to dictate what poor farmers can and cannot grow.It is the farmers who buy GMO seeds or not, and the farmers who decide whether to spend thousands of dollars a year on an “organic” certification to sell their seed to rich, fat Westerners who can afford to pay extra for food with the o-word on the label. Not all farmers can afford to get the “organic” label. But all farmers prefer to save money for higher yields, and it is now very obvious that GMOs reduce costs, improve yields, and make lives better for farmers internationally. Every year more and more farmers switch to GMOs, and the majority are small farmers in developing world nations. The organic movement is based among wealthy, upper-class people in food-secure nations like Europe where people can choose to pay more and get less. But in food-insecure nations, farmers are switching to GMO in droves, and living better lives because of it.As it is a very well established fact [and every year more evidence makes this even clearer] that GMOs are safe for human consumption and even are better for the environment than conventional crops [40% reduction in pesticides], there is no reason not to eat a GMO. So the main reason I would not eat a “non-GMO” is because it is more expensive… and often is identical to the foods without the label. Very few crops actually come in GMO. In fact, as of 2018, there are only ten plants on earth with GMO forms, and half of those are not used for human food, such as cotton and alfalfa. So just because something doesn’t have a “non-GMO” or “organic” label on it, doesn’t mean it is a GMO. For example, there is “non-GMO” sea salt being sold in stores. Salt. Sodium chloride. A non organism with no genes. All salt is non-GMO, because salt is not an O and has no G to M! Yet people will put a non-GMO label on salt, just to sell it at a higher price to people so ignorant of biology they think salt can be a GMO! I will not support such a scam.I would strongly recommend Quora legend Craig Good’s blog post: Boycott the butterfly, and stop buying organic. Well cited and well-written, he makes a good argument why one should specifically avoid non-GMO.","2018-03-19T07:56:20.694Z","QW5zd2VyQDA6NzY2ODgyODA=","false","Shelomi","Matan","31","2239","https://www.quora.com/profile/Matan-Shelomi","2973986","2463872","https://www.quora.com/For-those-who-support-GMO-can-anyone-explain-why-people-should-choose-GMO-over-non-GMO-foods/answer/Matan-Shelomi"

"159383802","Ok, let me take the easier route and grammatically and conceptually modify this question a bit.Why should the world, as a matter of course, adopt a hypothetically GMO positive stance?I am not going to use a lot of references or get too pompous and blustery about it, just keep things simple.The simple answer is because of what is at stake, the issues currently being faced and ones likely to be faced in the future. There is no other technology out there that even comes close to addressing the critical issues involved.Take so-called Soybean Frankenfood, for instance. One of the world's major mono-crops. These have recently been genetically modified to increase protein content, reduce saturated fat and increase oleic oil content.  OMG! Really scary stuff!You know, with population increasing reasonably dramatically, global warming posing issues for food production and crops and looming water shortage disasters, what are all these gormless, well-meaning, know-nothing, anti-science DFs offering as an alternative?Organic?Look, I like the whole touchy-feely idea of an Organic World, too and happen to be lucky enough to live in a part of the globe that can afford it. But organic growing methods are not cost or resource effective on the scale required, producing rather abysmal crop yields per acre, especially when compared to GMOs. This poses a real problem for less well-heeled areas of the globe, who can't easily indulge themselves and ''go organic'' like our good anti-GMO neighbours around the block can.So, if I am a poor, starving, nation desperately trying to feed its millions, developing in the face of all sorts of opposing forces and considering the risk/benefit ratio of my options to get out of the starving hole I find myself in...GMOs are probably going to look more like Miracle than Franken Foods to me.And what if I am a big, prosperous, well developed nation or even a well-fed citizen in one, do I really have to support a GMO positive position, too? And if so, why?Because I imagine that your 1st World status agrees with you and don’t fancy having to keep sending your armies over to these pesky 3rd World nations to quell dissatisfied food rioters or unhappy & hungry terrorists.I also would prefer not to go hungry myself, leave my children wanting or see my neighbours scrounging through trash piles looking for dinner. As a human being, I assume that others may feel the same way.In addition, having to think about half the population on this planet starving to death, either slowly or quickly, now or in the future doesn’t strike me as anything but a rather gruesome way to spend my precious time on this planet.","2019-08-07T15:46:23.768Z","QW5zd2VyQDA6MTU5MzgzODAy","false","","A.

"109898844","Here are a few good reasons to choose GMO over non-GMO:Cost. Generally, if you want to avoid GMO foods, this means buying food clearly labelled as organic. From personal experience at my local supermarket, this can mean paying a premium of 25 per cent or up to 600 per cent (yes, organic can be six times as expensive). I’m not sure what the average premium for Non-GMO is, but I think it’s safe to say there will be one. No one would add a label to their product if it threatened to make them *lose* money.Honesty. “Non-GMO Project” labels often appear on products that have no GMO equivalent. For example, if you see such a label on a bunch of grapes, it’s misleading, since there are no GMO grapes. Ditto for tomatoes, by the way - there are no longer any GMO tomatoes on the market, although they still feature prominently in imagery depicting tomatoes with syringes stuck in them (a scare image that is not even close to how GMOs are made).Environment. GMOs allow farmers to grow crops more efficiently (less fuel burned, hence fewer carbon emissions). They can also use fewer and more benign crop protection products (glyphosate, glufosinate ammonium) or dramatically lessen (possibly even eliminate) the need for insecticides (Bt built-in insect resistance in corn and eggplant, for example).Food security. GMO techniques allow crop breeders to develop new varieties faster by introducing only those desirable traits that are of interest. This means they don’t need to spend years breeding out all the undesirable traits that come along for the ride with conventional breeding. As climate change affects the world’s food growing regions, we need to be nimble in developing varieties that will allow our farmers to adapt and keep feeding us.","2018-11-27T19:20:34.862Z","QW5zd2VyQDA6MTA5ODk4ODQ0","false","Robin","Michael","4","952","https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-Robin-14","2973986","357635594","https://www.quora.com/For-those-who-support-GMO-can-anyone-explain-why-people-should-choose-GMO-over-non-GMO-foods/answer/Michael-Robin-14"

GMOs are initially used to upgrade general change to dietary substance. The GMO crop has raised worries over their own advantageous in that they are impervious to illnesses, produces more prominent yields, and it enhances the sustenance of nourishments devising the general population ignorant about their holding. Each time we go to any supermarkets or grocery stores, we would not know whether the vegetables and natural products are genetically modified.GMO crops should not be banned as GM substances can be extremely nourishing and can have a much bigger yield than un-adjusted harvests. This is especially helpful in spots like Africa where there isn’t great soil to develop the important products to manage themselves. GM nourishments can also withstand colder climates and droughts. Their development time is additionally less in GM subsistence. Developing countries can also sell the crops produced in order to help them in financial trouble.Hereditarily altered nourishments are gainful to nature, well-being, and are more solid than typical plants. By designing the BT poison in the genomes of plants, researchers have diminished the requirement for pesticides. The BT poison is just dangerous to the creepy crawlies that eat it. Likewise, it’s innocuous to people. This is superior to utilizing customary pesticides since its objective particular, and it influences the bugs that eat underlying foundations of plants and in addition those that tunnel in the plant tissues. Those bugs were beforehand unaffected in light of the fact that pesticides are connected to the plant remotely.Then again, numerous individuals trust that genetically altered sustenance is hurtful to the body. Hereditarily adjusted item is the after-effect of a long biochemical research and item improvement. In spite of the fact that researchers are creating organic chemistry for the lessening of destructive things in the item, regardless, this item conveys a hazardous substance for the body. These unsafe substances consequently prompt to various gastric infections and issues with the skin. This nourishment can likewise prompt to genuine infringement of the body’s digestion system, which prompts to a standout amongst the most unsafe issues of humankind – weight. As indicated by measurement of an American researcher, many individuals have stoutness, as a result of eating GM nourishment.In addition, due to the truth that GM merchandise can reason serious fitness troubles people have commenced searching for new methods to replace such dangerous food. “A main UN/World Bank-sponsored file compiled with the aid of 400 scientists and endorsed through 58 international locations concluded that GM crops have little to provide world agriculture and the challenges of poverty, hunger, and climate change because better selections are available.

Also, agriculture region is working to enhance new methods of farming, which can replace GM food.As I would see it, I think GMO products should be banned as the young era of individuals will have distinctive infections of eating these GMO sustenances. Clearly, these days developing GMO crops has turned into a colossal industry that it can’t be stopped however, I accept there are different approaches to spare individuals from hunger.","2020-01-21T18:56:28.842Z","QW5zd2VyQDA6MTkzNDU5OTE1","false","Chappell-Depte","Nevaeh","1","390","https://www.quora.com/profile/Nevaeh-Chappell-Depte","2973986","297605858","https://www.quora.com/For-those-who-support-GMO-can-anyone-explain-why-people-should-choose-GMO-over-non-GMO-foods/answer/Nevaeh-Chappell-Depte"
"8818152","Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.  If you want to make a change, do it with your wallet.Also, please keep in mind that most GMO crops are grown as feed for livestock.

"25965992","I’m uncertain what you are asking for. Your explanatory three paragraphs, where you start by putting “scientists” in scare-quotes seem to indicate that you will not believe anything a “GMO supporter” has to say — the safety studies aren’t long term, the corporate entities who do the studies can’t be trusted, and have a profit motive to disregard human health. In other words, the question is asking for one thing, but you are also saying you aren’t going to listen. If that’s the case, why should anyone bother answering?I think your assertions are wrong, or at least highly biased.I believe that the regulatory agencies which require safety testing before market approval for GMO products are staffed by scientists and civil servants who, ultimately, are answerable to the people and are hired and paid to regard the health of the average citizen higher than crop yield. In the US, regulation and safety of GMO foodstuffs is regulated by the FDA, in combination with the USDA and EPA. The FDA was formed to fight dangerous food, drugs, and cosmetics, and is not beholden to agribusiness. The EPA for formed to protect the environment, and is not beholden to agribusiness. Some have legitimate complaints about how much the USDA is beholden to agribusiness, but they are not the only ones determining the marketability of a GMO product.I believe the farmers which buy GMO seedstock do so with the knowledge that it is more economical, in terms of overall crop yield and need for expensive fertilizers and pesticides, to use GMO seeds than non-GMO seeds. They also know that if their crops were unsafe, they would go out of business, so they pay attention to the health risks as well.I don’t say anyone should eat GMO foods, I say no one should avoid them. If they are as good for you, and less expensive than organic, non-GMO food (and a lot of studies have shown that organic is no healthier than conventional (GMO or not)), then there’s no reason to not eat GMO foods.","2016-08-02T17:41:12.569Z","QW5zd2VyQDA6MjU5NjU5OTI=","false","Buck","Buddha","11","1280","https://www.quora.com/profile/Buddha-Buck","2973986","5096964","https://www.quora.com/For-those-who-support-GMO-can-anyone-explain-why-people-should-choose-GMO-over-non-GMO-foods/answer/Buddha-Buck"

"88214015","Okay. Two answers so far, equally mistaken, from opposite sides of the GMO debate.TLDR: GMOs won’t kill you. They’re neither an unremitting good nor a definite evil. They’re a mixed bag of risks and benefits, like almost everything else in this world. They need to be closely monitored.There is no proof that GMO crops are any less nutritious than normal hybrids. All GMOs planted and marketed in the US and the EU have undergone extensive testing to ensure that they are safe for consumers.You have not been eating GMO crops all your life. Genetically modified organisms are created in labs, by using scientific techniques to isolate desirable characteristics and insert the genetic material that codes for that into plants from a different species. It is not the same as selecting the wheat with the largest heads of grain and hybridizing them to create a new variety, which is what we have been doing with plants since we were pre-agricultural foragers, selectively gathering the most desirable types of grains and other plant foods.The overwhelming majority of GMO crops are corn, cotton and soybeans, and a large percentage of those are destined for industrial uses like biodiesel, not for your table.GMOs are more extensively tested than any other agricultural product. They’re tested and monitored by three different government agencies in the US: the USDA, The FDA, and the EPA. It typically takes three years of testing to approve a new GMO for commercial use.The Bt modification allows farmers to use fewer pesticides and get more product per acre. It provides plants with natural insecticide that repels pests. That’s a good thing for farmers and consumers, by and large.That same modification can crossover to wild plants and may have an unknown effect on pollinators. There haven’t been enough field trials and research to determine the effect yet. That really should have been done before any GMOs were planted outside of a controlled environment, but at this point, it’s too late to put the genie back in the bottle. That is most definitely a bad thing for the environment, driven by the agricultural lobby’s haste to get new crops into production.The modification that makes crops resistant to Round Up and other herbicides also tends to cross fertilize with weeds, making them more resistant as well. It is also frequently sprayed on fields a few days before harvest to desiccate the crop, making it easier for machines to harvest. That means there is more herbicide sprayed on the GMO crops that do end up in the supermarket, but Round Up is used on non-GMO crops as well.Round Up and similar herbicides are suspected of causing non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The active ingredient in most of them, glyphosate, is currently the subject of numerous court cases. Internal emails have recently come to light that Monsanto knew about the issue and tried to cover it up. Monsanto has also been known to employ ghostwriters to disseminate misleading information about their products.It is important to note that the GMOs themselves do not cause cancer. It’s the herbicide they are designed to resist that’s the culprit.It isn’t always possible to tell good information from bad when it comes to GMOs. One article I found on the Forbes website is a guest post by an employee of Monsanto. Hardly an objective opinion.It isn’t immediately obvious which fruits and vegetables are GMOs, but almost all zucchini and yellow squash, and all of the papayas that show up in US markets are GM crops. They have been modified to be resistant to viruses that are otherwise very costly to deal with.It’s easy to avoid eating GMOs if you select produce that carries the USDA certified organic label. No GMOs are allowed to be used in certified organic produce or in prepared foods that carry the label.Only ten types of plants have been approved for commercial use in the US. Nobody is flooding supermarkets with stealth GMOsThere is nothing about GMOs that justifies the hysteria that often greets the topic.

"1498844","The term GMO stands for \I make this distinction because the food we eat has been genetically modified since long before recombinant techniques became viable. For decades, seed companies have used irradiation, chemical exposure, and other techniques to spawn mutations in crops. While such techniques are hit-and-miss, they still produce novel genes, and are not subject to the public opprobrium or the regulatory hurdles of recombinant organisms. For some reason, new varieties created using recombinant techniques have engendered much more public concern than \So, are GMO foods intrinsically bad for you? According to the World Health Organization, usually not (http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/). While the program is technically optional, all biotech companies in the U.S. go through a safety evaluation with the FDA before selling any GMO seeds. Such evaluations look at such factors as whether the inserted genes transfer any allergens from other plants or introduce any toxic compounds.There was a well-publicized fiasco around Starlink corn, which contained a gene for the bacterial Bt toxin, a type of insecticide. The variant of Bt in Starlink, called Cry9C, broke down more slowly in the human digestive tract than the Bt used in other GMO corn. The FDA considered this an enhanced allergen risk, and in 1998 approved the corn for commercial use only (e.g. animal feed). Unfortunately, it found its way into the human food supply anyway. 28 people claimed to experience allergic reactions to Starlink corn, but a CDC analysis of their blood found nothing to support this (http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehhe/cry9creport/pdfs/cry9creport.pdf).Nevertheless, this has led the FDA to become much more cautious about approvals. Since the Starlink incident, the FDA only approves GMO crops that meet all of the standards for human consumption.Beyond FDA requirements, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety came into effect on Sept. 11, 2003, and governs most international shipments of GMO products that have the capability to reproduce (e.g. intact seeds). Since most biotech companies want to sell crop seeds internationally, they have to meet international standards for both food safety and environmental safety.There certainly have been cases of GMO crops that have failed testing. For example, there was an attempt to create a transgenic soybean that included albumin from Brazil nuts. Soybeans are a staple food in much of Asia, and diets there are often deficient in the essential amino acid methionine as a result; this was an attempt to add more methionine to soybeans. Unfortunately, Brazil nut albumin is a potent allergen, and people allergic to it were also allergic to these transgenic soybeans. The development was abandoned, and no one was hurt as  result. (http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/386/1317.full)Regulations aside, the potential liability that would result from a biotech company releasing a toxic seed is massive. As Starlink demonstrated, it is very expensive and difficult to contain a crop variety once released to farmers. The idea that a company such as Monsanto would risk a massive set of lawsuits that could take down the company in order to rush a GMO crop to market is somewhat absurd.","2012-09-02T20:42:44.670Z","QW5zd2VyQDA6MTQ5ODg0NA==","false","Seidman","Jim","53","12191","https://www.quora.com/profile/Jim-Seidman","110895","2237861","https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-concerns-with-genetically-modified-organisms-and-food-If-GMO-food-has-the-potential-to-dramatically-increase-our-food-production-why-is-it-so-bad/answers/1498844"

"97757346","First of all, organic farming uses pesticides too. They try to only use chemical pest control as a last resort, but you as the consumer have no way of knowing whether the farmer who grew a particular organic apple was desperate or not.Second, even conventional crops can have pesticides inside of them. Systemic pesticides are plant protectants that are absorbed by the plant and circulate within it. They achieve similar results as GM crops that produce their own pesticides. The difference is that systemic pesticides may also contaminate the environment.Third, there is no safety difference whether the pesticide is within or on the surface of your produce. I’m not sure what country you are from, but here in the United States we have a system in place that ensures consumer safety from pesticides. The concentrations of pesticide residues allowed in food are literally orders of magnitude lower than they need to be according to safety testing. This includes all pesticides, whether they are in or on your food.If you are worried about your own safety, then it doesn’t make a difference. We are talking about concentrations that are often fractions of a part per million. By the time you consume enough to cause an issue, you will have literally eaten yourself to death. I assume that all developed nations have similar safety measure in place, so you really don’t have much to worry about unless your country is really behind on food quality control.If you are worried about the environment, I guess you would be better off with GMOs. The only pesticide producing GMOs I know of make Bt toxin. Bt toxin has a pretty narrow spectrum so it doesn’t hurt many non-target species. At least not at the concentrations found in nectar or pollen. There was a study that suggested that Bt crops may hurt bees or butterflies. However followup studies showed that only a few variants of Bt crops had that issue, and they were being phased out anyway.","2018-09-01T20:58:45.957Z","QW5zd2VyQDA6OTc3NTczNDY=","false","Williams","Elijah","4","481","https://www.quora.com/profile/Elijah-Williams-23","33727952","84961176","https://www.quora.com/Is-it-better-to-eat-GMO-foods-that-are-inherently-pest-resistant-or-pesticide-laden-non-GMO-foods-Organic-non-GMO-food-alone-cannot-support-the-earth-s-population/answer/Elijah-Williams-23"
"17287553","I'm not one to speak for everyone, but-\nPart of the problem stems from the fact that American media and politicians commonly say things that aren't true. You could also blame the hippie movement, Christianity, or any number of things. But the truth is that GMOs are organisms that humans have changed, and people don't know what kind of things could arise from these man-made creations. Some people are in fear of what could happen if we continue to make GMOs; the big frankenfood scare of just a decade ago was mostly based off of that. The media and politicians come and play at people's fears, the people that are afraid of having \The phrase \Some companies don't help with the public image of GMOs either, for example McDonalds, in November of 2014, announced that they would no longer use GMO potatoes for their fries. This actually spurred a slew of angry internet denizens that claimed that GMOs must have something wrong with them if McDonalds is suddenly trying to stop using them. If you know people that are afraid of GMOs, try to get them to read a little more about how they are made, and what kinds of benefits that they have to try and dispel their fear. It's not that GMOs carry no risks, but all of these plants that are now commercially available have gone through FDA approval are are assured safe by the American Government.Lastly, just a side note, but you can't get away from GMOs. As of 2012, 88% of corn and 94% of soy crops in the US were genetically modified (mostly with BT or roundup ready strains). Given the prevalence of #2 corn in every facet of processed food, GMOs really are everywhere. Cows, chickens, and pigs are fed GMO corn, GMO corn is used to make corn syrups and a concoction of different carbohydrates used as preservatives, commercial additives and flavor enhancing agents that find their way into almost every single processed food product in America. But don't fear, there's no reason to worry about GMO's ruining your life, because these products are EXACTLY THE SAME as the products that would come out of non GMO corn. Vitamin C and sorbitol made from GMO corn are exactly the same as vitamin C and sorbitol made from non GMO corn, they're just chemicals, like you can get sugar from sugar beets or sugar cane, it's all sucrose. In the end, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly why people are afraid of GMOs, but a lot of it definitely boils down to fear and a \Investigate on.","2015-11-24T22:43:02.596Z","QW5zd2VyQDA6MTcyODc1NTM=","false","Dong","Jason","50","21849","https://www.quora.com/profile/Jason-Dong-11","110195","77076387","https://www.quora.com/Why-is-GMO-food-bad-for-you/answer/Jason-Dong-11"
"309993314","It’s not just that I don’t avoid GMO foods — if I’m offered two brands, and one is labeled “Non-GMO” and the other isn’t, I’ll take the other.I will only buy a food labeled “Non-GMO” if there is no alternative, and even then, I think twice about whether or not I have to have it.GMO foods are a huge benefit in the developed world, and a God-send to the developing world.In the western world, avoiding GMO products increases our food prices. That’s bad, but not tragic. The tragedy occurs in the developing world. When we in the west shun GMO products, we take away the incentive for companies to develop new products which could ease food shortages in other parts of the world, and that could address health conditions that plague developing countries (see, for example, Golden rice). This despite the fact that there is not a shred of evidence that GMO products are unsafe.So I avoid foods that are labeled as “Non-GMO” whenever I can.Fair warning: I have absolutely no involvement with the food industry in any way, other than the fact that I eat food. Any comment that accuses me of being in the pocket of “Big Ag” will be deleted within the hour.","2021-09-24T21:40:33.651Z","QW5zd2VyQDA6MzA5OTkzMzE0","false","Shulmann","Mark","10","1672","https://www.quora.com/profile/Mark-Shulmann","100153828","151102776","https://www.quora.com/Do-you-avoid-consuming-GMO-foods-or-food-containing-GMO-ingredients/answer/Mark-Shulmann"
"4173964","The current answers explain why farmers choose GMOs (in short: because it makes farming easier and more profitable). Here are reasons why some farmers do not.1) The right GMO does not exist yet. If you are a millet farmer or a cassave farmer, there currently aren't good GMOs for you. Most of the technology is in corn, soy, and cotton, and a few outliers. At other cases, the GMO is for a crop you grow, but the wrong trait. Say you are a corn farmer in Southeast Asia. GMO corn that reduces the need for manual weeding (Roundup Ready) doesn't help you because labor is cheap. What you need are traits for drought or salt tolerance specific for your region. Such GMOs may not exist yet. You would use GMOs, but the right one hasn't been invented for you yet.2) You are afraid you will lose export rights. This is a big factor in Africa, which exports most crops to Europe. Europeans are very anti-GMO, and restrict its import (though these restrictions are lifting). Many African governments worry that, if even a single GMO crop is grown in their nation, Europe will cut all agricultural exports from them. It's an exagerrated (but not entirely false) risk, yet it's enough that many African governments banned GMO planting. You would use GMOs, but European anti-GMO fears force you to use less efficient crops to keep your market. Economics are more important than any perceived health or environmental risks here.3) You are an organic farmer. That is probably a state you have on principle. You sell enough to survive, and at a high premium, which means you live in or trade with an area wealthy enough to afford organics, like Europe. You don't need GMOs to survive, so have the luxury of not using them.4) You are poor, in a war-torn region, in a region with poor infrastructure, etc. You couldn't get access to GMO crops if you wanted them. You likely couldn't get the fertilizers that were at the heart of the Green Revolution either. Again, this is a scenario in parts of Africa. You would use GMOs if your economy/government wasn't in shambles.5) Your government won't let you. This is a small scale but growing problem. The big island in Hawaii, for example, recently banned GMO crops. This was a huge problem for papaya growers, as nearly all papaya is a GMO [the Hawaiian gov ended up grandfathering papaya in, meaning it gets an exception and can still be grown]. Other regions or countries are experiencing the same thing. Its a victory for anti-GMO activists and organic farmers (who stand to make a lot of money if they are given total control of the market), but a huge loss for farmers. Another example: in the Phillipines, a test farm of Golden rice was destroyed by anti-GMO activists… who were all city kids. The actual farmers who observed the destruction were horrified (destroying a rice plant is taboo) and disappointed. You would use GMOs, but other people made it illegal.Note the absence of health or environmental concerns here. The truth is GMO s more of an economic and sociopolitical issue than anything else.","2014-02-18T06:19:39.525Z","QW5zd2VyQDA6NDE3Mzk2NA==","false","Shelomi","Matan","5","1197","https://www.quora.com/profile/Matan-Shelomi","822063","2463872","https://www.quora.com/Agriculture-Why-do-farmers-use-or-not-use-GMO-crops-What-benefits-restrictions-factor-lead-to-this-decision/answer/Matan-Shelomi"
