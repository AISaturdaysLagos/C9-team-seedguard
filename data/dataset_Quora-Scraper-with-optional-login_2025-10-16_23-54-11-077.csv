"4","Europe generally imposes a higher standard for safety than does the US. Europeans subscribe to something called the precautionary principal - the principle that the introduction of a new product or process whose ultimate effects are disputed or unknown should be resisted. The notion is that the research can continue, and when the results are known to be safe the product can be added. Effectively, they haven’t said that GMO foods (of which there are many varieties with potentially very different impacts) are bad: they’ve said that we don’t know they are safe and we are unwilling to become guinea pigs while the companies figure it out.The US requires proof that something ISN’T safe - which, with ingredients that may have long term or incremental impact, can be difficult or impossible to show. Further, GMO isn’t actually regulated here by the FDA. There is no rule here that bars process changes (there is in the EU but not here), and GMO isn’t regarded as an additive, so the rules that the FDA is given (by congress) don’t apply. In the initial case where they dragged their feet and were unwilling to approve rBST , congress stepped in and passed a law making it legal. So again, it wasn’t really subjected to safety tests - only economic pressure.","2019-07-30T16:19:43.351Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1MzU2OTk2Mw==","2","53569963","What makes European regulators think GMO food is so bad for health?","https://www.quora.com/What-makes-European-regulators-think-GMO-food-is-so-bad-for-health"

"55","No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.","2014-08-04T14:38:10.138Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyMjU0MTYx","5","2254161","Are genetically modified foods harmful to human health in the long run?","https://www.quora.com/Are-genetically-modified-foods-harmful-to-human-health-in-the-long-run"
"14","The only proven health issues with GMOs are possible allergic reactions. But those occur with non GMO foods too. The health and environmental benefits of GMO foods are substantial: higher nutrition levels, fewer inputs(fertilizer and pesticides) higher yields, longer season, wider range of growing areas, etc. I wii cite a couple of real, not theoretical, examples.In the western US the Pink Bollworm (PBW) is a big threat to cotton. It only feeds on cotton and okra, a close relative. The adult moth lays eggs on the cotton boll (fruiting structure that holds the seed and lint fibers) When the eggs hatch the larva (worm) eats its way into the boll, heading for the seed, which holds the protein it needs to survive. The worm is vulnerable to chemical control for 2–3 days, then it is too far into the boll to kill. Once the worm reaches the seed the boll, and lint is ruined. Some growers try to time spraying by trapping and counting the moth flights, picking the peak times to spray. You can never get all of the worms or moths unless you spray every night, which is cost prohibitive and environmentally un sound. A recent GMO discovery has for the most part solved this problem. Plant breeders have found way to “inject” cotton with a bacteria, Bacillus Thuringensis, into cotton. The seed of that inoculated cotton actually has the bacteria in it, which spreads throughout the plant as it grows. The PBW hatches and feeds on any part of the plant and it ingests the BT, which causes the worm to die. As a result 6 to 10 pesticide applications are eliminated. That means the cotton growing regions use thousands of pounds less pesticides every season. Did I mention the Bacillus Thuringensis is certified Organic?Another example of GMO benefits is Golden Rice. Some islands in the West Pacific Rim have been growing rice for generations with low levels of micronutrients. Beta Carotene- the orange in carrots- is needed in the diets of children aged 6 months to 10 years for Vitamin A production, which is responsible for eye development and general health. A million children die each year due to vitamin deficiencies and 500,000 children lose their eyesight due to lack of Vitamin A. After nine years of research Golden Rice emerged. It has higher levels of Beta Carotene in the grain kernals, so much so that it has an orange-gold color. Two cups of Golden Rice a day provides all of the Beta Carotene needed to maintain good eyesight That’s why your Mom kept saying “Eat your carrots, you’ve never seen a blind rabbit have you?”Golden Rice production and distribution has has been hampered by some governments who delay its use or stop it with excessive regulation. BT cotton has been criticized as being “dangerous” or a product of “Frankenfarming.” But GMO agriculture can lessen fertilizer, pesticide, or even water use. Genetically Modified plants can provide more food that is more nutrient laden, stays fresh longer, and is easier to transport.American researcher Norman Borlaug was the father of the first Green Revolution in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. During that time the world’s population grew by 100%, but food production grew by 150%, proving the 1700s economist Malthus terribly wrong, and the 1900s ag economist Boserup thankfully right. GMOs represent the next Green Revolution.","2014-08-18T16:09:30.484Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyMzEwODY5","6","2310869","What, if any, are the health issues from products sourced from GMO agriculture?","https://www.quora.com/What-if-any-are-the-health-issues-from-products-sourced-from-GMO-agriculture"
"11","There are strong studies which linked GMOs to harmful effects, including cancer.This famous French study was first dropped from the journal due to pressure and lobbying from Monsanto corporation and other american interests, but when its researchers sued the journal in the court and won on grounds that the research and its data was scientifically solid and viable, it was republished by the very same journal that dropped it upon pressure, by court order.Page on the-scientist.comThis study - Seralini Study - basically repeated the exact experiment Monsanto corporation used to vouch for the safety of its GMOs. The difference is that, Monsanto's test duration was merely 90 days, whereas Seralini study kept the experiment going for Two years.
This is the Seralini team's official website:GMO SeraliniHere is where they answer all criticism:Critics answeredLong story short, the French GMO study which linked GMOs to cancer in rats is valid, solid, and not 'debunked' as so many corporate outlets in USA claim - some of which immediately proceeded to 'debunk' the study even without one week passing from its publication.This example should illustrate what kind of political games and profits hang around the concept of GMOs.You can see what kind of pressure corporations have their governments exert from below example:EU dropped plans for safer pesticides after pressure from USYou can guess that it is no different in the case of GMO studies around the world.And yes, GMOs are banned in many countries:Twenty-Six Countries Ban GMOs—Why Won’t the US?The article asks, why doesn't US ban GMOs...The reason is simple and is a two word phrase: Monsanto Corporation.This is a massive corporation which does exorbitant profits based on GMOs. Incidentally, they are also the inventors and producers of Agent Orange chemical weapon, which USA used in Vietnam. And Aspartame artificial sweetener , which was linked to cancer itself.Aspartame controversyNow, the reason why such stuff are 'controversial' is solely because these corporations spend massive funds in order to do propaganda for their benefit. Like how they declared they were going to spend advertising money to combat 'global warming propaganda', and thus made global warming a 'controversial issue' in USA - not the rest of the world, or how energy saving light bulbs have become a 'cancerous, dangerous technology' in USA with same kind of advertising spending - to the extent that there is a strong segment of americans who think that incandescent lightbulbs are 'freedom' and they are 'safe'. While they pay ~70% more for the lighting they are using with incandescent bulbs.............GMOs actually pose a far greater danger than cancer risk or other health risks to individuals:Once a modified organism gets out into the wild and succeeds in reproducing, you can never take it back. Consider it like a virus.And you can never expect what the effects of such a rogue GMO will be in the wild in the broader ecosystems - on insects, other plants, and bigger animals and eventually entire ecosystems.To understand how big ecosystem damage can be, consider the case of big snakes (pythons) which had been released into the wild by pet owners from Florida when they grew too big:Florida Python Invasion: ‘No Going Back’ As Snake Population Spirals Out Of ControlThey are a plague now, totally changing the ecosystem by their presence. What will it end up in, no one can tell.This is despite they are NOT a genetically modified creature - they are totally normal, but we cant even take them back.GMOs are much more virulent. They are modified to not be able to produce by themselves in the wild. However, they can crossbreed with other organisms of their own species, and therefore you can never tell when one of the strains that you were putting in the wild will succeed in breaking away and changing maybe entire wold with no way to turn it back.And the effects of the combinations of the modified genes with whichever non modified member of their species they mate and breed outside the lab, is not known, and due to insane number of probabilities which span variations and future generations, will never be known.There is a reason why environmental organizations set up a seed bank in Norway to protect original, unmodified versions of our fauna and flora.Svalbard Global Seed Vault","2015-10-14T02:07:16.836Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1NTYyMzg1","7","5562385","Is GMO food really harmful to human health and banned in some developed countries like US?","https://www.quora.com/Is-GMO-food-really-harmful-to-human-health-and-banned-in-some-developed-countries-like-US"
"15","Hundreds of such studies have been done, including long-term effects, by researchers across the globe and done in public institutions with public funding. In fact, there's a list: Studies with independent fundingThe conclusions are clear: no negative effects. GMO's are just as nutritious as non-GMO's (except when they are designed to be even more nutritious, like Golden Rice) and cause no health problems. Here is a literature review of these results, and another assessment of GE food safety here.Note that studies do exist saying GMO's are bad… but you asked for good ones. Studies existed saying vaccines cause autism and that cigarettes are harmless, but those studies were flawed and a few were retracted. It is important to 1) not let a single study trump the dozens of studies that contradict it, 2) not confuse opinion papers with actual science research, and 3) be sure that any study has valid controls, a large sample size, no conflict of interest (be it big-Agritech or big-Organic, both of which have millions to burn), and is otherwise scientifically sound. A study that tried to show GMO corn gives rats cancer, for example, was debunked when scientists pointed out they used cancer-prone rats in the study, who would have gotten sick even if they were fed organic food, or nothing at all.Ultimately, while political and economic opposition to GMO's may be valid, the science is clear that they are safe. Scientists are disappointed that anti-GMO activists, like anti-vaccine activists and climate change deniers, are twisting the facts or denying overwhelming evidence to lie to their constituency and get political points.","2013-05-29T08:42:33.570Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxMTUyODc3","8","1152877","What are some good widely accepted scientific research studies about the safety of GMO products?","https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-widely-accepted-scientific-research-studies-about-the-safety-of-GMO-products"
"28","I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control. This is not product that is being sold to help American families.The link below was deleted by the magazine after sharing. Here is the backup.China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be Buying (deleted after sharing)China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be BuyingThe Snack Food and Corn Syrup Lobbyist Shaping Guidelines for AmericansIf you’re consuming mostly genetically modified organisms into your diet, it means that you are not cooking your food from scratch. Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day. That is pretty sad.","2015-10-23T10:49:07.575Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1NjUwNjQz","9","5650643","Is there evidence that GMO foods are bad for you?","https://www.quora.com/Is-there-evidence-that-GMO-foods-are-bad-for-you-1"

They may be located within the plant, e.g., a potato, which is an underground stem, and thus be impossible to wash off.American agriculture has depended on the assumption that it didn’t matter what was applied to growing crops because no toxic potential would remain by the time the food was on the table.

They have done nothing to verify the scare-mongering rubbish that they publish, and often they feed off each other without looking for any new information at all.It’s important to distinguish among the various forms of GE. The safety of Roundup-ready crops can’t be compared with that of crops integrating genes from Bacillus thuringia, since the former requires the use of even heavier doses of a human-toxic herbicide (Roundup) than regular crops of the same species do, while the latter require little or no pesticide use unlike the traditional crops of the same species.Anyone who reads the actual science published in reputable, peer-reviewed journals will understand that what they call GMOs (genetically-modified organisms) are just the latest in a long line of organisms genetically modified by humans that began when agriculture started, thousands of years ago. Farmers have always used various tools to do this, and now they have tools that originate in labs to use as well. That’s all it is.Because of the fears expressed by people who can’t or won’t understand the real science of it, any newly-modified organism that has been produced by lab techniques instead of the older breeding techniques is exhaustively tested before being made available to farmers. So you can be quite certain that even if there were something to fear in the whole GE matter, which there is not, then whatever organisms make it into the fields are totally safe, something that can’t be said for the products of all the older techniques that have not been tested.Here are a few references to real science instead of uninformed fear:A Nature article about the induced controversy and the deceitful techniques used to spread fear of GE: Scientists avert new GMO crisisA Science article about the benefits and safety of growing GMOs: Plant Biotechnology in Chinahttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779909000511An overview of the last 10 years of genetically engineered crop safety researchIn case the question changes, the one I answered was:“Why do people think that GMO is bad for your health?I think it is”","2017-03-30T15:08:10.273Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxMzk5OTU5OQ==","14","13999599","Why do people think that GMO is bad for your health?","https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-think-that-GMO-is-bad-for-your-health"

Not only are they extremely safe beyond any reasonable doubt, but they also have the potential to save the million or more people that die from starvation and the half-million or more that permanently lose their eyesight from malnutrition every year. A GMO is simply a food derived from an organism that has had it’s DNA altered somehow to make it bigger, tastier, heat resistant, cold resistant, etc. The way DNA is altered today is by using enzymes (little chemically active proteins) to cut open DNA and insert DNA from a different organism that has a desirable gene. That DNA they inserted is foreign and therefore people think that this must mean that it’s harmful in someway. However, while the DNA is foreign, it is still just DNA and acts just as it did in the (also edible and nonharmful usually) animal that it was taken from. Any organism you consume (plant or animal) has DNA in it anyway which still isn’t harmful… you could litteraly drink the stuff. If the DNA inserted coded for something toxic to humans then it probably wouldn’t be labeled as safe to eat by the FDA.People say that GMOs “must” be harmful but that’s just it; these are just random people not scientists. No credible Scientist has ever said that GMOs are harmful. That’s not to say there weren’t/arn’t some crackpot conspiricy theorists parading around as scientists who ignore the scientific method to obtain largely falsified results that suit the imaginary point they’re trying to prove. There are a few commonly cited “studies” that suposedly prove that GMO’s cause health defect but absolutely none of them are recognized by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine who concluded that “no substantiated evidence that foods from GE crops [are] less safe than foods from non-GE crops [exists].” One notable example is a study that claimed to have found evidence that mice fed GMO’s developed tumors due to their diet. That study was complete bs for a few reasons; it had no control group (genetically similar mice fed non-GMO food to establish that the mice didn’t just commonly grow tumors anyway) which was probably because the breed of lab mouse he used is highly predisposed to growing tumors.The only logical argument against GMOs is that while known GMOs are safe, in theory, new and untested ones might not be (heavy emphasis on the “in theory”) However, any genetically modified crop released to consumers in any country has been tested and approved by the food and drug administration, any scientist who is cautious of GMO’s is really only cautious (with good reason) about the relaxation of the laws regarding the testing and certification of GMOs. The reason many popular chains like whole foods swear off GMOs is because it’s a publicity stunt and a marketing technique (if you think they’re above that, then you should look at that time they sold a bottle of water with asparagus in it for $8 each).A poll by the Pew Center in 2015 which found that 88% of scientists think that GM crops are safe while only 37% of the public agrees; this is the largest gap in opinion between the scientific community and the public over any existing issue, including climate change.TL;DR Nothing.I got a 5 on the AP Biology exam, I got a 5 on the AP Statistics exam, and I had the privilage of writing a research paper on GMOs in AP Language and composition.","2017-12-11T22:17:17.653Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyMTY2MTUyMA==","15","21661520","Exactly what is it about GMO foods that can endanger your health?","https://www.quora.com/Exactly-what-is-it-about-GMO-foods-that-can-endanger-your-health"
"2","The notion that GMOs are inherently more likely to cause health problems than traditional crops is bogus pseudoscience promoted by 'studies' funded by European agribusiness, including Carforre. (The scientists accepting funding from Auchan and Carforre unethically failed to disclose the source.)Auchan and Carrefour financed CRIIGEN studies on GMOs.The CRIIGEN studies, and others like them, deliberately present misleading conclusions. It's possible to criticize particular GMO crops. But I can also tell stories about conventionally bred crops which caused health problems. For example; A strain of traditionally bred celery was high in furanocoumarins, and the people who handled the stuff got a rash which was worse than poison ivy. There is no evidence that the process of genetic modification itself causes health issues. (Admittedly,  I'm frustrated by the fact that antibiotic resistance genes which would confer resistance to clinically used antibiotics are still used in the process of genetic modification. There's no scientific support that I'm aware of that this technique promotes antibiotic resistance, but it's stupid to take the risk when there are other ways to do genetic modification.)Modern agriculture requires the periodic introduction of new crop varieties to prevent various pathogens and parasites becoming too well adapted to particular varieties so you'd have introduction of new germ material, by necessity, even with conventional breeding. Conventional breeding techniques actually introduce far MORE uncertainty into the world's food supply.If you really wanted to make a scientifically accurate case against GMOs you shouldn't focus on the notion of genetic modification, per se. Most of the things that can be done with genetic modification can also be done with conventional breeding and there's zero evidence that genetic modification causes health issues of any kind. 
Instead, focus on the perverse economic incentives that exist in agriculture and what it would mean if those incentives were satisfied at a faster rate. For example; if it were possible to create food with a longer shelf life then the produce would sit in the store longer. If it's possible to grow food which is more resistant to pesticide, then more pesticide might be applied. Would genetic modification speed up the rate that this happens at? Ask any farmer how they choose their crops. They'll talk about disease resistance or time to harvest. Taste or nutritional value are typically not on the list of criteria when they decide what to plant. Purchasers of juicing oranges make their decisions primarily on the sugar content of the oranges (since that's a proxy for ripeness.) And those incentives are a problem, regardless of how the crop is produced.But these problems won't be solved by eliminating GM crops, only slowed down. The incentives themselves need to be changed.","2013-08-03T00:10:49.666Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxMjYwMjUz","16","1260253","What are some scientifically valid points for GMO's causing health problems?

"3","Genetically modified organisms are plants that have novel genetics often outside the plant kingdom, inserted into the nucleus in seeds via a gene gun. This is very different from hybridization where two or more parents from the same species are used to produce seed that grows into a plant.One can turn a open pollinated plant such as soya, as well as F1 hybrids such as dent or sweet corn into GMOs.Some GMOs are bad for health as they have the wrong sized proteins but most of the time those GMOs are screened out and never hit the food stream. GMOs are bad for soil health as they demand a monoculture and a lot of herbiocode use to get that monoculture which kills the soil and leaves it open to a lot of erosion and flooding, but I don’t think you are asking that question. As far as human health GMOs are not bad for humans other then they are used in highly processed foods that are way too high in salt, fat and sugars causing obesity, high cholesterol and a diabetes in a huge portion of the population. though most of the corn and soya GMOs are used for livestock feed and industrial uses such as lubricants","2022-04-24T11:03:41.824Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxMTYxMTUyODk=","17","116115289","What is the difference between GMO and non-GMO?

"7","Unless you gather wild plants and hunt wild animals (well actually hunting and fishing causes animals to evolve, like severe fishing with legal size limits makes dwarf mutants that are sexually mature but below the size limit have a survival advantage), everything you eat has been modified even inadvertently by man in some way.This is done through domestication, hybridization, natural mutation in the old days to mutation breeding (yep there are varieties of “organic”crops that were made in a laboratory) and genetic engineering.Natural does not necessarily mean healthier, and modified by man either through old or new methods does not necessarily mean less healthy. Rapeseed has erucic acid, which is poisonous. So man invented canola which is highly modified. Yes, canola is only a few decades old. Cassava produces cyanide which poisons people from time to time, and in small doses has other bad effects. But there are different varieties which contain much less to no cyanide.What about other more common vegetables? Well look at it this way. Cassava produces cyanide probably as a defence against organisms that like to eat its leaves. Pretty much every other plant including vegetables do this. Tomatoes are part of the Solanaceae family which includes the nightshade plants. So its no mystery where in the family the tomato gets its chemical warfare genes.Okay, simple logic. If you are a tomato (or whatever plant) farmer from long ago before pesticides, how do you propagate your crop? Simple, you get the plants which yield more then plant their seeds or whatever. And how do those plants yield more? Before pesticides this means the plants produce their own. Yup, those things on your dinner plate are the winners of thousands of years of evolution where pests eat the plants. Only the strong or in this case only those who produce the strongest natural pesticides surviveThese pesticides obviously work otherwise many generations of farmers would no have saved and replanted the seeds. But how healthy are they for you? Are there any safety tests that prove that they are healthy?We calculate that 99.99% (by weight) of the pesticides in the American diet are chemicals that plants produce to defend themselves. Only 52 natural pesticides have been tested in high-dose animal cancer tests, and about half (27) are rodent carcinogens; these 27 are shown to be present in many common foods.Dietary pesticides (99.99% all natural).To answer your question, no. GMO and non GMO foods have equal potential to be either good or bad for you, its the specific details that matter. But a lot of people spread the lie the natural is good for you in order for them to be able to sell more of their products.One criticism of GMO is that a lot of GMO plants are designed to be herbicide resistant and this promotes the use of that herbicide and the herbicide may be bad for you. Well the evidence that it is bad for you is suspect. But even if it were one day proven to be bad for you, thats specific to that herbicide and since you can have GMO’s without that herbicide then it is not a condemnation of GMO’s as a whole.Also, so called “organic” produce has the potential problem of natural carcinogens made by the plant itself as well as the fact that “organic” produce can use old fashioned herbicides and pestdicides that are also toxic and since they are less potent, more are used.","2018-08-21T11:11:15.668Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozMzIwMjM4Ng==","19","33202386","Does eating non-GMO food really improve your health?","https://www.quora.com/Does-eating-non-GMO-food-really-improve-your-health"
"5","People say there is no difference between (GMO and non-GMO) (Corn syrup and sugar) (organic and nonorganic) in terms of health. What is your opinion?These three separate questions with different answers!GMO – I’m not aware of any documented health difference between a GMO and its non-GMO relatives, except of course where the GMO variant has been specifically engineered for better nutrition, for instance rice with elevated vitamin A. A food product doesn’t ‘know’ or care what lab procedures led to its existence or the construction of its DNA. The old shotgun method was to induce mutation with UV or toxic chemicals and screen the mutations for valuable traits. The rifle-shot approach of a GMO more efficiently makes specific changes and then submits the new organism to rigorous testing and review. Give me GMOs, thank you.Corn syrup – It’s become fashionable to bash corn syrup. The recent ad from Anheuser Busch (owned by Belgium’s InBev) during the Superbowl was fun but a silly piling-on to this fad. There’s nothing wrong with corn syrup and you’d be very hard pressed to prove that sugar from cane or beet is better than that from corn. This is especially true in the case of beer, since the sugar is mostly fermented away to alcohol and carbon dioxide, and AB uses carbohydrate from rice instead of corn. Big deal.The bashing of corn syrup probably stems from extending the bashing of HFCS, high fructose corn syrup. Studies have implicated fructose in some health issues, and it may be true that fructose is less safe than glucose. But we don’t eat glucose. We eat sucrose, and do you know how much fructose is in sucrose? Half. We have an enzyme in our stomach called invertase that converts sucrose into its component sugars of glucose and fructose within minutes. Know how much fructose is in HFCS? About half. The two standard commercial HFCS products are 42% or 55% fructose. These are hard to distinguish from invert syrup, the result of invertase action on sucrose. (A small amount of HFCS90 is also made, but it’s not anywhere nearly as common as HFCS42 and 55.) The point is, choosing sugar over corn syrup does nothing to help you avoid fructose, which in turn is only weakly implicated in health issues that are correlated with chronic and excessive consumption. Is fructose really a problem if you’re not also over-consuming sugar and calories? I’m skeptical.Organic – There is no dispute that organic products are often healthier than their non-organic competition. Studies have shown generally lower levels of pesticides and herbicides, and occasionally higher levels of healthy nutrients in organic produce. We still cannot make a blanket statement that organic products are always better, though. Organic products are not uniformly “worth it”. A reasonable approach is to spend more for organic for the products where it matters more, which is often for products you don’t peel, such as strawberries.","2019-01-24T01:54:39.795Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo0MTE4OTE0MA==","20","41189140","People say there is no difference between (GMO and non-GMO) (Corn syrup and sugar) (organic and nonorganic) in terms of health.

"4","Well, we have had 25 years of consumption with no validated adverse effects on human health. Let’s add in that over a hundred Nobel laureates think they aren’t a problem after looking at the hundreds of scientific studies done on them.My thought is that any adverse effects from the gmo foods currently on the market are not likely at all.What the future will bring is hard to predict. I suppose that someone might use some new technology and/or find a regulatory loophole resulting in something problematic…..but that isn’t very likely for a number of reasons.First, gmo foods are usually regulated by at least two agencies, USDA and FDA. If they also have a pesticide effect then it is 3, adding in EPA. That is a lot of regulation. It will be hard to try and slip something past the system in the U.S.Second is the way new varieties are introduced into commerce. When a new variety is developed they don’t just plant the entire crop with it and hope that no one has a problem. They try it in test plots. Panels do taste tests (organoleptic studies). Do you really think huge billion dollar businesses just toss all their eggs into one basket without first testing the product first? It is a slow and deliberate process.Third is that gmo’s remain controversial. They are under the media microscope. Everyone will know that a new gmo product will be hitting the grocery stores and/or the salad bars of America. There is intense pressure to get it right or the producers get hurt financially and the sellers (grocery stores, restaurants, etc) will get slammed in the media costing a fortune. That is the main reason why gmo potatoes never made it commercially. The biggest buyer of potatoes is McDonalds and they said they would not use them because the bad press would be too costly. Personally that is a shame because a lot of neonicotinoid pesticide applications could have been prevented.Finally, the U.S. is a litigious society. If one person get’s hurt from a food product the lawyers will line for a huge payday suing everyone in the chain of production, distribution, and sales. It could run into the billions quickly.These are some of the reasons why there are so few gmo fruits and vegetables on the market today.The only other possibility where a gmo product causing adverse effects might make it to the shelves would be some form of radical bioterrorism.","2018-12-28T13:02:19.238Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozOTY2NjY5MQ==","22","39666691","Do you think that consuming GMO foods will cause health issues?","https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-consuming-GMO-foods-will-cause-health-issues"

But all of those intended as food crops were tested before they were released. So far there have been no credible reports of anyone being harmed by eating any GM foods. There isn’t any known reason for that to change.There is one GM food that is expected to have an effect on human nutrition. Golden rice carries a gene making a precursor to vitamin A. It has the potential to eliminate a deficiency disease in countries that rely on rice as a staple food. Opposition to GM foods in the first world has restricted its planting. Some third-world commentators have criticised this as ‘cultural imperialism.’Bigger crops of more nutritious foods will impoverish soil unless fertilisers are used. Agricultural runoff can then becomes a problem. Modifying plants to fix atmospheric nitrogen reduces the need for added fertiliser. That could lead to reduced pollution of waterways.Glyphosate-resistant crops allow weeds to be suppressed using a specific weedkiller. In the short term it allows farmers to use glyphosate which is the least toxic of the common weedkillers. But it does encourage the growth of resistant weeds and that will become a problem.It’s a complicated problem.
