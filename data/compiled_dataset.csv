27.0,"Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.  If you want to make a change, do it with your wallet.Also, please keep in mind that most GMO crops are grown as feed for livestock.  So you must keep meat and dairy choices in mind when shopping, as well.",2014-12-26T18:52:46.940Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyOTczOTg2,3.0,2973986.0,"For those who support GMO, can anyone explain why people should choose GMO over non-GMO foods?",https://www.quora.com/For-those-who-support-GMO-can-anyone-explain-why-people-should-choose-GMO-over-non-GMO-foods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26.0,"You can take this question in one of two ways.  If you want to answer the question \proactively label their GMO-containing foods?\Justin Ma has a great answer.  I take the question to mean \regulations that require them to label food that contains GMO-derived ingredients?\I will focus on the United States, since that is where I am most familiar with the regulatory environment. Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do. Basically, the people who just claim that mandatory labeling laws would just \For those who insist on providing information to consumers, there is a way you can do this: label your own products the way you want, and don't force others to do so.

16.0,"Genetically Modified Organism. However what that means can be one of contention and you really need to ask who you are talking to. In many debates they are talking about intergenus genetic modification (of any process) especially those like Bt-Ready and Roundup-Ready. The anti-GMO debates tend to be mostly anti-Monsanto and focus on those types of modification.Some labeling laws have limited their scope to just this as well. Vermont's H.112 (Page on State) defines it as \The organic standard is a bit more direct: \Excluded methods. A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production. Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macroencapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology). Such methods do not include the use of traditional breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture.\Code of Federal Regulations)Some researchers are trying to separate the terms and use other terms for what they do depending on whether they are doing their breeding outside taxonomic group or not. There are also some trying to argue the organic standard should take the difference in public opinion (breeding vs anti-monsanto) into account (see Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics, and the Future of Food: Pamela C.

62.0,"The same exact reason people are opposed to lab-grown diamonds: because an industry that makes immense profits from “organic” food has spent billions of dollars waging an immense propaganda campaign to whip people who don’t know how to do their research into a frenzy targeted at their business rivals.You even see some of that propaganda being repeated right here in the answers to this question, by people who sincerely believe whatever they’re told they’re saying.There’s a great example of this right here in this answer thread, by Tomaž Vargazon. I’m not picking on him; I generally find his content well-written and well-researched. But in this case, his answer is filled with misinformation and urban legend.For example, a common urban legend is that Monsanto sued farmers for accidental contamination, pursuing anyone with even a few stray plants in their fields so aggressively they bankrupted them.This story was invented by one man, a farmer in Indiana named Vernon Hugh Bowman. He collected soybean seeds from a grain elevator, planted them, then sprayed them with glyphosate to kill the ones that were not GM. He then planted his entire field with them.He tried claiming “accidental contamination” when he was sued, spinning a yarn that not even a jury of his peers believed. (Hint, when more than 95% of the plants on your farm are the same strain, that’s no accident, LOL.) He was convicted by a jury of his peers, but the story he spun stuck.I used to believe this story myself, just like Tomaž. Then someone challenged me to the same challenge I am about to make to Tomaž, and anyone else weho believes it:Name the farmers sued for this.All court cases in the US are public. If this happened, there should be plenty of examples. Cite cases. Name someone. You won’t be able to do it.In fact, Monsanto sent out people free of charge to clean out accidental contamination from any farmer who reported it.As for the “dangers” of glyphosate:Moreover, the company hid internal studies that showed their key moneymaking herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) wasn’t as safe as advertised. It was linked to an increase of cancer risk with gross overexposure.No.The overall incidence of cancer amongst people exposed to glyphosate is lower (yes, seriously!) than baseline.Lower. Not higher. Yes, seriously.The UN “study” that listed glyphosate as a “suspected carcinogen” is widely ridiculed in medical and scientific communities.So, why does this happen?$$$ money $$$Whenever you have a huge amount of money on the line, you will have a huge amount of money available for propaganda.People like to say Monsanto was this huge megacorporation. Actually, no, when it existed, it was kind of a pipsqueak.Organic foods, on the other hand, are an immense, fat-profit business. Sales of organic foods are more than triple Monsanto’s revenues.Organic food is huge, with much fatter profits than conventional or GM food, and organic food makers have poured billions of dollars over the yearsinto anti-GM propaganda—propaganda that well-meaning, otherwise intelligent people accept because it matches their bisaes and fears.I come to this from the position of a person who once believed as Tomaž and others do: Monsanto was an evil giant megacorporation, GM companies patented foods and that was bad, they bullied small farmers, and so on and so on.I started questioning that narrative when I started asking specific questions:How big is the GM food industry? How big is the organic food industry? Which is bigger?What farmers did Monsanto bully, specifically? What were their names? What were the case numbers? What farmers “lost their farms” because of Monsanto? Who were they?If GM food is bad because of food patents, then why did the first food patents get issued in the 1800s, before genetic engineering was a thing? Why are organic foods patented? (Spoilter: Yes, organic and conventional foods are also patented! Surprise! It’s amazing how many people legitimately don’t know this.)Once you start down these rabbit holes, you end up in a very different place than you started from.Why are so many people opposed to GM food? Because people are fearful about food in general, people have a purity fetish around food, and a lot of extremely profitable corporations spend a ton of money to make people frightened of GM food.Add in anti-corporate narratives and it becomes an easy sell.",2013-11-07T22:36:18.877Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxNDI0OTkx,6.0,1424991.0,Why are so many people opposed to genetically modified food?,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-so-many-people-opposed-to-genetically-modified-food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55.0,"No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.",2014-08-04T14:38:10.138Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyMjU0MTYx,7.0,2254161.0,Are genetically modified foods harmful to human health in the long run?,https://www.quora.com/Are-genetically-modified-foods-harmful-to-human-health-in-the-long-run,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28.0,"Well, it is a topic on which a long debate could be done on.As being a biotechnologist (pursing undergraduate course in biotech), my views are as follows:A variety of GM crops are being harvested in various parts of the world and many are still being worked on. The best part of GM crops is their high yield, good nutritional quality, a good shelf life, could be harvested in lesser time than the normal ones and the point of my interest- could be used to make edible vaccines (would'nt it be great- nutrition and vaccination all in a single shot- could be quite handy for poor countries and UN). Now on to the GM organisms. Till now, I have not known to any GMO. But I still know that they are being worked on. Their best use could be for MOLECULAR PHARMING (i.e obtaining vaccines and other biological agents like insulin from animal milk or any other by-product). Their are many GM Microorganisms, which are being used industrially in breweries and other pharmaceutical or I should say neutraceutical (nutritional + pharmaceutical) companies, and have revolutionized this sector.But the cons are bio-ethics.

49.0,"Music.Music is what happens when a song is played -- either a performance or a recording of a performance. Music cannot be separated from the experience of listening to it in a way that can be owned.Recordings aren't even owned. They are licensed to you for limited uses by the copyright holders, in most cases, it'd the record label the artist has signed over their rights to.What we think of as the recordings we own on digital file, CD, phonograph, cassette, 8-track, or whatever -- these are merely containers for the recordings. We own the containers, but we do not own the recordings contained within them.It all boils down to this: what we think of as ownership of music is actually us paying for the right to access the music. In a world where the technological cost of providing global access to the entire history of recorded music is easily covered by charging a small fee or tax for access, the idea of music ownership will and should be considered anachronistic. Music is free. What we pay for is access.Of course, musicians need some sort of fair compensation to stimulate the production of music. This is the purpose of copyright in the first place. But musicians have never been fairly compensated for their music. Over the last few centuries, a microscopic minority of musicians became wealthy, while the music industry itself grew to a multibillion dollar enterprise. Increasingly, copyright is used by corporations to stifle technological innovation the maintain the status quo of musician exploitation and the lie of musical ownership. Prior to the invention of the recording, music could only be generated through a performance. There had to be musicians playing within earshot in order for one to experience music. Or, you had to play the song yourself. The economics were simple -- musicians enjoyed the support of their patrons, and later, the public became patron as live music flourished. The recording -- and the concept of music ownership -- shut down much of this burgeoning live music scene. The great irony is that after the recording dominated 20th century music, the 21st century brought the disruption of digital distribution, causing us to give new value the live performance and viewing the recording for what it really is -- a facsimile of a single performance. As such, we have a new generation of listeners and musicians that recognize music ownership is a capitalist illusion, access to music should be free like tap water (which we perceive as free but in reality is paid for as a utility), and live performance should be held up as the ultimate authentic music experience. This is why the concert industry is booming and record sales are plummeting.",2013-03-18T21:27:06.892Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxMDMzMTg3,10.0,1033187.0,"What are things people think they own, but they actually don't (e.g. a mortgaged home, software, GMO seeds)?",https://www.quora.com/What-are-things-people-think-they-own-but-they-actually-dont-e-g-a-mortgaged-home-software-GMO-seeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

29.0,"A genetically modified organism, is simply an organism who’s genes has been modified, as a result of human intervention by performing genetic engineering. This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is! And how/what’s that? We take the gene, that acts like a blueprint on how to make this hormone, from a healthy person. We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin. Soon, you have thousands of bacteria producing this hormone, and the quantity and quality of this insulin is good enough to become an economically viable manufacturing process, and that’s how you get insulin these days.So who was the GMO here? It was the bacteria. You manipulated the genetic material of the bacteria, so that it produced more insulin, which was for your own benefit, and made medicine cheaper.By the way, which kind of egg do you have?",2016-01-27T16:35:36.742Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo2NzMyNzY1,12.0,6732765.0,What is a genetically modified organism (GMO)?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-genetically-modified-organism-GMO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

28.0,"I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control. This is not product that is being sold to help American families.The link below was deleted by the magazine after sharing. Here is the backup.China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be Buying (deleted after sharing)China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be BuyingThe Snack Food and Corn Syrup Lobbyist Shaping Guidelines for AmericansIf you’re consuming mostly genetically modified organisms into your diet, it means that you are not cooking your food from scratch. Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day. That is pretty sad.",2015-10-23T10:49:07.575Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1NjUwNjQz,15.0,5650643.0,Is there evidence that GMO foods are bad for you?,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-evidence-that-GMO-foods-are-bad-for-you-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17.0,"Neither in my opinion. Is the farmer a knowledgeable and honest grower? That’s the question of importance.Organic means that it has been grown without the application of synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. However, this does not prohibit the farmer from applying natural pesticides (pyrethrines) at high concentrations too close to harvest or applying manure from animals that were given high doses of antibiotics.The responsibility of what is good or not lies with the farmer. Not the product.If you follow the instructions of how to properly grow a crop from an agronomist it does not matter, which method or seed you use; organic or conventional farming, non-gmo or gmo. There are no nutritional differences measured from either type of crop cultivation. Flavor-wise it is better to buy from a farmer’s market than a supermarket, where they harvest immature vegetables and fruits, but nutritionally they are almost identical as well.Non-GMOs means that the product has been produced through traditional breeding methods which is a very long procedure (10–15 years). GMOs could have a disease resistance or drought resistance gene inside them from a related species or not, etc. This has absolutely no effect on you, unless we are talking about a toxin introduced into the plant, which companies avoid anyway doing that. Companies do not want dead or ill consumers. They want hungry and healthy consumers to keep buying their products. Period.So, to answer your question:I would consider more important Organic vs non-organic, although there is no practical difference between them for you. I just expect that Organic farmers would be more diligent as small-scale farmers about their concern for your food. GMOs vs non-GMOs just does not matter.Personally I would choose the farmer first and then my products.",2018-11-11T02:35:12.378Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozNzIyOTY5Ng==,16.0,37229696.0,What’s more important: organic or non-gmo?,https://www.quora.com/What-s-more-important-organic-or-non-gmo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23.0,"Thanks for he A2A.\n \nI am uneasy about these answers here. Not that they are wrong, they're not. But they aren't telling the full story.\n \nLet's look at some common GMO crops. Corn. Soybeans. Cotton. Canola ( rapeseed). Alfalfa. There's more, but these will do fine for what we are talking about.\n \nNow we need to separate the crops into 2 subsets. Those crops that are self pollinated and those that are outcrossers. Selfers are plants that pollinate themselves by having the pollen drop into the stigma of the flower without needing outside help, like an insect or the wind, thus ensuring a tomato, or a chile pepper, or a wheat kernel. \n \n \nOutcrossers need help to spread pollen. That head of broccoli needed mostly bees to help create it, or that ear of corn needed some strong wind to spread pollen.\n \nOk. So. Selfers- Soybeans. Cotton. \n \nOutcrossers.- Corn. Canola. Alfalfa. \n \nCrops that are selfers don't suffer from inbreeding depression, a term that means they lose their viability over time from having too little genetic diversity during the growing season. So saving seed from one tomato plant, one wheat plant, one bean plant is fine. That seed can be grown and resaved for a lifetime.\n \nOutcrossers aren't like that. They need lot's of genetic diversity, which to the farmer means they  grow a lot of plants. One broccoli plant? No way. One carrot plant, one corn plant, one canola plant? No. Think at least 500 to start, and no less than 100 to finish. They need pollination from a large population of plants. Without this, the seed is very poor, genetically bottlenecked and usually unfit for next generational use. \n \nOk?\n \nNow let's further separate these crops into 2 types. Open pollinated and hybrid. \n \nOP crops are old fashioned crops that our grandparents and parents grew, including heirloom varieties. If you grow, for example, an heirloom tomato, and decide to pull some seeds out of one of the tomatoes, it will \hybrid vigor, and clearly outshines the parents.

13.0,"I have trouble with the terminology, but the concepts are clear.GMO, or genetically modified organisms, are the essence of agriculture. For thousands of years, farmers, agronomists, plant scientists have used plant and animal breeding to manipulate the genetic makeup of the foods we eat. That is a good thing.However, GMOs as they are developed today, uses recombinant DNA manipulation to alter the attributes of the plants. As a result, it is possible to introduce changes that we would never see in nature (i.e. introduction of animal characteristics into plant material). While that’s not necessarily bad, we also greatly reduce the time it takes to see the changes in the material, and therefore we can’t fully investigate the unintended consequences of our manipulations. Every technological innovation has risks of unintended consequences, but genetic manipulation can have broad, catastrophic impacts. It’s kind of like nuclear power generation: it’s a great thing when everything is fine, and failure may be very rare, but the impacts can be huge. I advocate continuing research, but proceeding slowly. I also believe in detailed labelling to enable consumers to make their own choices.Organic foods fall into a different category. The term “organic” is meaningless and requires significant explanation in order to be useful for consumers. I do not believe that inorganic fertilizers are “bad” and I do not believe that all herbicides and pesticides are bad. Again, it’s a matter of really looking into the specific practices of cultivation. That’s one reason why I do agree with buying from local producers: the consumer has the ability to find out exactly how something was produced and to talk to the producer.",2016-03-25T20:32:50.899Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo3NDkyODY5,18.0,7492869.0,What is your opinion of GMO and organic foods?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-of-GMO-and-organic-foods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here is a literature review of these results, and another assessment of GE food safety here.Note that studies do exist saying GMO's are bad… but you asked for good ones. Studies existed saying vaccines cause autism and that cigarettes are harmless, but those studies were flawed and a few were retracted. It is important to 1) not let a single study trump the dozens of studies that contradict it, 2) not confuse opinion papers with actual science research, and 3) be sure that any study has valid controls, a large sample size, no conflict of interest (be it big-Agritech or big-Organic, both of which have millions to burn), and is otherwise scientifically sound. A study that tried to show GMO corn gives rats cancer, for example, was debunked when scientists pointed out they used cancer-prone rats in the study, who would have gotten sick even if they were fed organic food, or nothing at all.Ultimately, while political and economic opposition to GMO's may be valid, the science is clear that they are safe.

14.0,"The only proven health issues with GMOs are possible allergic reactions. But those occur with non GMO foods too. The health and environmental benefits of GMO foods are substantial: higher nutrition levels, fewer inputs(fertilizer and pesticides) higher yields, longer season, wider range of growing areas, etc. I wii cite a couple of real, not theoretical, examples.In the western US the Pink Bollworm (PBW) is a big threat to cotton. It only feeds on cotton and okra, a close relative. The adult moth lays eggs on the cotton boll (fruiting structure that holds the seed and lint fibers) When the eggs hatch the larva (worm) eats its way into the boll, heading for the seed, which holds the protein it needs to survive. The worm is vulnerable to chemical control for 2–3 days, then it is too far into the boll to kill. Once the worm reaches the seed the boll, and lint is ruined. Some growers try to time spraying by trapping and counting the moth flights, picking the peak times to spray. You can never get all of the worms or moths unless you spray every night, which is cost prohibitive and environmentally un sound. A recent GMO discovery has for the most part solved this problem. Plant breeders have found way to “inject” cotton with a bacteria, Bacillus Thuringensis, into cotton. The seed of that inoculated cotton actually has the bacteria in it, which spreads throughout the plant as it grows. The PBW hatches and feeds on any part of the plant and it ingests the BT, which causes the worm to die. As a result 6 to 10 pesticide applications are eliminated. That means the cotton growing regions use thousands of pounds less pesticides every season. Did I mention the Bacillus Thuringensis is certified Organic?Another example of GMO benefits is Golden Rice. Some islands in the West Pacific Rim have been growing rice for generations with low levels of micronutrients. Beta Carotene- the orange in carrots- is needed in the diets of children aged 6 months to 10 years for Vitamin A production, which is responsible for eye development and general health. A million children die each year due to vitamin deficiencies and 500,000 children lose their eyesight due to lack of Vitamin A. After nine years of research Golden Rice emerged. It has higher levels of Beta Carotene in the grain kernals, so much so that it has an orange-gold color. Two cups of Golden Rice a day provides all of the Beta Carotene needed to maintain good eyesight That’s why your Mom kept saying “Eat your carrots, you’ve never seen a blind rabbit have you?”Golden Rice production and distribution has has been hampered by some governments who delay its use or stop it with excessive regulation. BT cotton has been criticized as being “dangerous” or a product of “Frankenfarming.” But GMO agriculture can lessen fertilizer, pesticide, or even water use. Genetically Modified plants can provide more food that is more nutrient laden, stays fresh longer, and is easier to transport.American researcher Norman Borlaug was the father of the first Green Revolution in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. During that time the world’s population grew by 100%, but food production grew by 150%, proving the 1700s economist Malthus terribly wrong, and the 1900s ag economist Boserup thankfully right.

8.0,"An important key to understanding why Europe and the United States have chosen to regulate identical technologies in such a dissimilar fashion has to do with recent changes in politics of risk regulation in Europe. From the 1960s through the mid 1980s, the regulation of health, safety and environmental risks was generally stricter in the United States than in Europe. Since the mid 1980s, the obverse has often been the case: a wide array of European consumer and environmental regulations, including those governing GMOs, are now more restrictive than in the United States. In a number of important respects, European regulatory politics and policies over the last fifteen years resemble those of the United States between the late 1960s and the mid 1980s. They are often politicized, highly contentious and characterized by a suspicion of science and a mistrust of both government and industry. By contrast, the US regulation of GMOs resembles the European regulatory style of the 1970s: regulators have worked cooperatively with industry and been supportive of technological innovation, while non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have enjoyed little access to the policy process.That was from a very comprehensive paper on the subject of why the EU regulates GMOs more than the U.S. In short it has more to to with politics and risk aversion than actual good science.Please read the full paper to understand this more fully.

11.0,"Absolutely organic means of production can easily supply enough food to support not only current population but many many more people too.Hunger has very little to do with lack of supply in Today\u2019s World. Usually it is a symptom of poverty or war. There is food available but some just can\u2019t get to the food because they either can\u2019t afford it or there are people with guns in the way blocking access.Organic production solves some of these problems because generally it takes more labor to produce high quality organic produce. Not always but quite often. More labor means jobs for those poor who can\u2019t afford food. Furthermore not only do they gain jobs, the farmer always takes their personal food off the top before selling the excess as a cash crop. So these will be well fed poor rather than starving poor.But the majority of the problem is due to agriculture purposely being wasteful in the industrial models of production.\In reality organic production models properly integrated with animals and crops in symbiosis would cause an explosion of high quality food worldwide. None need be starving. But organic production would not be able to supply some of the purposely wasteful industries industrial ag currently supplies now. For example currently the U.S. produces 14 billion + U.S. liquid gallons of ethanol fuel. This is primarily made from excess corn production beyond what is possible for every man woman and child in the world to ever eat. Organic production models don\u2019t need to purposely produce extra corn so as to purposely waste it making fuels that nobody wants anyway. It is ridiculously inefficient anyway. But it was designed that way on purpose. Simply a way for industry to purposely make money off inefficiency. It would all collapse tomorrow without multiple billions and billions in government subsidies paid for by you and me propping it up.Now instead of growing corn to make ethanol fuel additives, we allowed the great tallgrass prairies to return and raised our food on that instead? Huge increases in primary productivity so large that even taking a smaller % would still easily beat the industrial production models hands down. In fact the current subsidized production models are so inefficient, making that change would still even allow ethanol production off the excess grass! Strange as it may sound, ethanol production is so inefficient and takes so much energy to produce, even a smaller amount of grass produced ethanol would have by far more net gain in energy!Grass Makes Better Ethanol than Corn DoesAnd we know full well grass makes better beef!

The big boys don\u2019t want the change and are doing everything in their power to prevent it. Why? Because they are not clever enough to profit from economies of abundance, having made all their profits from economies of scarcity. They are just not smart enough. Sorry but it is truth.

What will it end up in, no one can tell.This is despite they are NOT a genetically modified creature - they are totally normal, but we cant even take them back.GMOs are much more virulent. They are modified to not be able to produce by themselves in the wild. However, they can crossbreed with other organisms of their own species, and therefore you can never tell when one of the strains that you were putting in the wild will succeed in breaking away and changing maybe entire wold with no way to turn it back.And the effects of the combinations of the modified genes with whichever non modified member of their species they mate and breed outside the lab, is not known, and due to insane number of probabilities which span variations and future generations, will never be known.There is a reason why environmental organizations set up a seed bank in Norway to protect original, unmodified versions of our fauna and flora.Svalbard Global Seed Vault",2015-10-14T02:07:16.836Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1NTYyMzg1,27.0,5562385.0,Is GMO food really harmful to human health and banned in some developed countries like US?,https://www.quora.com/Is-GMO-food-really-harmful-to-human-health-and-banned-in-some-developed-countries-like-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44.0,"I’ll keep it relatively brief.I think the idea has merit, but in practice, GMOs have become a way for big companies to make a lot of money by encouraging farmers to grow their patented products, which show optimal performance typically in a chemically-intensive growing environment. And, not coincidentally, those chemicals are also sold by the companies which sell the patented seeds. Sure, that doesn’t describe all GMOs, but it does describe many. Feel free to peruse the approved varieties listed below.GM Approval Database- ISAAA.orgPeople will argue that GMOs are the answer to meeting food production demands for a growing global population. They say that current methods without GMOs won’t satisfy that demand after a point. I don’t think this is the right way to solve that problem — its like coming up with a drug to deal with the side-effects of another drug, but ignoring the original cause.What’s really going on is a degradation of soil as a natural resource as a result of conventional agriculture. Throwing more intensive conventional agriculture at the problem to circumvent the lowered output of a degraded resource will only further degrade that resource over time. The better answer would be to seek to replenish that resource — to rebuild soil. And the better way to do that is through no-till agriculture which integrates pastured livestock management and crop rotation.Here is a relatively short video of Gabe Brown giving a TedTalk on no-till agriculture.If you have the time for a much longer talk, which includes comparison of soil composition and testing, yields, water usage, etc., you’ll find others by searching on YouTube.no-till farming gabe brownBecause of the amount of information presented, these are considerably longer.These are real farmers using systems that rely less or not at all on costly chemical inputs — including fertilizer. Their production has gone up, and by integrating several revenue streams into their farming, they are able to get a lot more from their land than if they adopted conventional repeat-monocropping with chemical additions and patented seed. And while they’re at it, they’re rebuilding soil and sequestering carbon. To me, this is a better path than tweaking crops to be able to grow after being sprayed with herbicides.I’m not against all GMOs at all. I think there is much good that can come of this tool — the GMO virus-resistant papaya comes to mind, which can be grown where Papaya Ringspot Virus is prevalent and would otherwise make raising this crop impossible. So before anyone replies to this answer with “GMOs are safe” or “you’re anti-science” please just don’t bother. That’s not what my angst against some of them (i.e. herbicide-resistant crops) is about. I just don’t think they’re all they’re hyped to be, nor are they the solution I’d prefer. We don’t need to tweak crops to produce better in degraded soil — we need to replenish the soil.ETA — I keep trying to copy the video URL to start at the beginning, but it doesn’t seem to be working.

27.0,"Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.  If you want to make a change, do it with your wallet.Also, please keep in mind that most GMO crops are grown as feed for livestock.

26.0,"You can take this question in one of two ways.  If you want to answer the question \proactively label their GMO-containing foods?\Justin Ma has a great answer.  I take the question to mean \regulations that require them to label food that contains GMO-derived ingredients?\I will focus on the United States, since that is where I am most familiar with the regulatory environment. Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do. Basically, the people who just claim that mandatory labeling laws would just \For those who insist on providing information to consumers, there is a way you can do this: label your own products the way you want, and don't force others to do so.

In many debates they are talking about intergenus genetic modification (of any process) especially those like Bt-Ready and Roundup-Ready. The anti-GMO debates tend to be mostly anti-Monsanto and focus on those types of modification.Some labeling laws have limited their scope to just this as well. Vermont's H.112 (Page on State) defines it as \The organic standard is a bit more direct: \Excluded methods. A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production.

62.0,"The same exact reason people are opposed to lab-grown diamonds: because an industry that makes immense profits from “organic” food has spent billions of dollars waging an immense propaganda campaign to whip people who don’t know how to do their research into a frenzy targeted at their business rivals.You even see some of that propaganda being repeated right here in the answers to this question, by people who sincerely believe whatever they’re told they’re saying.There’s a great example of this right here in this answer thread, by Tomaž Vargazon. I’m not picking on him; I generally find his content well-written and well-researched. But in this case, his answer is filled with misinformation and urban legend.For example, a common urban legend is that Monsanto sued farmers for accidental contamination, pursuing anyone with even a few stray plants in their fields so aggressively they bankrupted them.This story was invented by one man, a farmer in Indiana named Vernon Hugh Bowman. He collected soybean seeds from a grain elevator, planted them, then sprayed them with glyphosate to kill the ones that were not GM. He then planted his entire field with them.He tried claiming “accidental contamination” when he was sued, spinning a yarn that not even a jury of his peers believed. (Hint, when more than 95% of the plants on your farm are the same strain, that’s no accident, LOL.) He was convicted by a jury of his peers, but the story he spun stuck.I used to believe this story myself, just like Tomaž. Then someone challenged me to the same challenge I am about to make to Tomaž, and anyone else weho believes it:Name the farmers sued for this.All court cases in the US are public. If this happened, there should be plenty of examples. Cite cases. Name someone. You won’t be able to do it.In fact, Monsanto sent out people free of charge to clean out accidental contamination from any farmer who reported it.As for the “dangers” of glyphosate:Moreover, the company hid internal studies that showed their key moneymaking herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) wasn’t as safe as advertised. It was linked to an increase of cancer risk with gross overexposure.No.The overall incidence of cancer amongst people exposed to glyphosate is lower (yes, seriously!) than baseline.Lower. Not higher. Yes, seriously.The UN “study” that listed glyphosate as a “suspected carcinogen” is widely ridiculed in medical and scientific communities.So, why does this happen?$$$ money $$$Whenever you have a huge amount of money on the line, you will have a huge amount of money available for propaganda.People like to say Monsanto was this huge megacorporation. Actually, no, when it existed, it was kind of a pipsqueak.Organic foods, on the other hand, are an immense, fat-profit business. Sales of organic foods are more than triple Monsanto’s revenues.Organic food is huge, with much fatter profits than conventional or GM food, and organic food makers have poured billions of dollars over the yearsinto anti-GM propaganda—propaganda that well-meaning, otherwise intelligent people accept because it matches their bisaes and fears.I come to this from the position of a person who once believed as Tomaž and others do: Monsanto was an evil giant megacorporation, GM companies patented foods and that was bad, they bullied small farmers, and so on and so on.I started questioning that narrative when I started asking specific questions:How big is the GM food industry? How big is the organic food industry? Which is bigger?What farmers did Monsanto bully, specifically? What were their names? What were the case numbers? What farmers “lost their farms” because of Monsanto? Who were they?If GM food is bad because of food patents, then why did the first food patents get issued in the 1800s, before genetic engineering was a thing? Why are organic foods patented?

55.0,"No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.",2014-08-04T14:38:10.138Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyMjU0MTYx,7.0,2254161.0,Are genetically modified foods harmful to human health in the long run?,https://www.quora.com/Are-genetically-modified-foods-harmful-to-human-health-in-the-long-run,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

49.0,"Music.Music is what happens when a song is played -- either a performance or a recording of a performance. Music cannot be separated from the experience of listening to it in a way that can be owned.Recordings aren't even owned. They are licensed to you for limited uses by the copyright holders, in most cases, it'd the record label the artist has signed over their rights to.What we think of as the recordings we own on digital file, CD, phonograph, cassette, 8-track, or whatever -- these are merely containers for the recordings. We own the containers, but we do not own the recordings contained within them.It all boils down to this: what we think of as ownership of music is actually us paying for the right to access the music. In a world where the technological cost of providing global access to the entire history of recorded music is easily covered by charging a small fee or tax for access, the idea of music ownership will and should be considered anachronistic. Music is free. What we pay for is access.Of course, musicians need some sort of fair compensation to stimulate the production of music. This is the purpose of copyright in the first place. But musicians have never been fairly compensated for their music. Over the last few centuries, a microscopic minority of musicians became wealthy, while the music industry itself grew to a multibillion dollar enterprise. Increasingly, copyright is used by corporations to stifle technological innovation the maintain the status quo of musician exploitation and the lie of musical ownership. Prior to the invention of the recording, music could only be generated through a performance. There had to be musicians playing within earshot in order for one to experience music. Or, you had to play the song yourself. The economics were simple -- musicians enjoyed the support of their patrons, and later, the public became patron as live music flourished. The recording -- and the concept of music ownership -- shut down much of this burgeoning live music scene. The great irony is that after the recording dominated 20th century music, the 21st century brought the disruption of digital distribution, causing us to give new value the live performance and viewing the recording for what it really is -- a facsimile of a single performance. As such, we have a new generation of listeners and musicians that recognize music ownership is a capitalist illusion, access to music should be free like tap water (which we perceive as free but in reality is paid for as a utility), and live performance should be held up as the ultimate authentic music experience. This is why the concert industry is booming and record sales are plummeting.",2013-03-18T21:27:06.892Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxMDMzMTg3,10.0,1033187.0,"What are things people think they own, but they actually don't (e.g. a mortgaged home, software, GMO seeds)?",https://www.quora.com/What-are-things-people-think-they-own-but-they-actually-dont-e-g-a-mortgaged-home-software-GMO-seeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

29.0,"A genetically modified organism, is simply an organism who’s genes has been modified, as a result of human intervention by performing genetic engineering. This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is! And how/what’s that? We take the gene, that acts like a blueprint on how to make this hormone, from a healthy person. We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin.

28.0,"I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control. This is not product that is being sold to help American families.The link below was deleted by the magazine after sharing. Here is the backup.China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be Buying (deleted after sharing)China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be BuyingThe Snack Food and Corn Syrup Lobbyist Shaping Guidelines for AmericansIf you’re consuming mostly genetically modified organisms into your diet, it means that you are not cooking your food from scratch. Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day. That is pretty sad.",2015-10-23T10:49:07.575Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1NjUwNjQz,15.0,5650643.0,Is there evidence that GMO foods are bad for you?,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-evidence-that-GMO-foods-are-bad-for-you-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17.0,"Neither in my opinion. Is the farmer a knowledgeable and honest grower? That’s the question of importance.Organic means that it has been grown without the application of synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. However, this does not prohibit the farmer from applying natural pesticides (pyrethrines) at high concentrations too close to harvest or applying manure from animals that were given high doses of antibiotics.The responsibility of what is good or not lies with the farmer. Not the product.If you follow the instructions of how to properly grow a crop from an agronomist it does not matter, which method or seed you use; organic or conventional farming, non-gmo or gmo. There are no nutritional differences measured from either type of crop cultivation. Flavor-wise it is better to buy from a farmer’s market than a supermarket, where they harvest immature vegetables and fruits, but nutritionally they are almost identical as well.Non-GMOs means that the product has been produced through traditional breeding methods which is a very long procedure (10–15 years). GMOs could have a disease resistance or drought resistance gene inside them from a related species or not, etc. This has absolutely no effect on you, unless we are talking about a toxin introduced into the plant, which companies avoid anyway doing that. Companies do not want dead or ill consumers. They want hungry and healthy consumers to keep buying their products. Period.So, to answer your question:I would consider more important Organic vs non-organic, although there is no practical difference between them for you. I just expect that Organic farmers would be more diligent as small-scale farmers about their concern for your food. GMOs vs non-GMOs just does not matter.Personally I would choose the farmer first and then my products.",2018-11-11T02:35:12.378Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozNzIyOTY5Ng==,16.0,37229696.0,What’s more important: organic or non-gmo?,https://www.quora.com/What-s-more-important-organic-or-non-gmo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23.0,"Thanks for he A2A.\n \nI am uneasy about these answers here. Not that they are wrong, they're not. But they aren't telling the full story.\n \nLet's look at some common GMO crops. Corn. Soybeans. Cotton. Canola ( rapeseed). Alfalfa. There's more, but these will do fine for what we are talking about.\n \nNow we need to separate the crops into 2 subsets. Those crops that are self pollinated and those that are outcrossers. Selfers are plants that pollinate themselves by having the pollen drop into the stigma of the flower without needing outside help, like an insect or the wind, thus ensuring a tomato, or a chile pepper, or a wheat kernel. \n \n \nOutcrossers need help to spread pollen. That head of broccoli needed mostly bees to help create it, or that ear of corn needed some strong wind to spread pollen.\n \nOk. So. Selfers- Soybeans. Cotton. \n \nOutcrossers.- Corn. Canola. Alfalfa. \n \nCrops that are selfers don't suffer from inbreeding depression, a term that means they lose their viability over time from having too little genetic diversity during the growing season. So saving seed from one tomato plant, one wheat plant, one bean plant is fine. That seed can be grown and resaved for a lifetime.\n \nOutcrossers aren't like that. They need lot's of genetic diversity, which to the farmer means they  grow a lot of plants. One broccoli plant? No way. One carrot plant, one corn plant, one canola plant? No. Think at least 500 to start, and no less than 100 to finish. They need pollination from a large population of plants. Without this, the seed is very poor, genetically bottlenecked and usually unfit for next generational use. \n \nOk?\n \nNow let's further separate these crops into 2 types. Open pollinated and hybrid. \n \nOP crops are old fashioned crops that our grandparents and parents grew, including heirloom varieties. If you grow, for example, an heirloom tomato, and decide to pull some seeds out of one of the tomatoes, it will \hybrid vigor, and clearly outshines the parents.

13.0,"I have trouble with the terminology, but the concepts are clear.GMO, or genetically modified organisms, are the essence of agriculture. For thousands of years, farmers, agronomists, plant scientists have used plant and animal breeding to manipulate the genetic makeup of the foods we eat. That is a good thing.However, GMOs as they are developed today, uses recombinant DNA manipulation to alter the attributes of the plants. As a result, it is possible to introduce changes that we would never see in nature (i.e. introduction of animal characteristics into plant material). While that’s not necessarily bad, we also greatly reduce the time it takes to see the changes in the material, and therefore we can’t fully investigate the unintended consequences of our manipulations. Every technological innovation has risks of unintended consequences, but genetic manipulation can have broad, catastrophic impacts. It’s kind of like nuclear power generation: it’s a great thing when everything is fine, and failure may be very rare, but the impacts can be huge. I advocate continuing research, but proceeding slowly. I also believe in detailed labelling to enable consumers to make their own choices.Organic foods fall into a different category. The term “organic” is meaningless and requires significant explanation in order to be useful for consumers. I do not believe that inorganic fertilizers are “bad” and I do not believe that all herbicides and pesticides are bad. Again, it’s a matter of really looking into the specific practices of cultivation. That’s one reason why I do agree with buying from local producers: the consumer has the ability to find out exactly how something was produced and to talk to the producer.",2016-03-25T20:32:50.899Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo3NDkyODY5,18.0,7492869.0,What is your opinion of GMO and organic foods?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-of-GMO-and-organic-foods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies existed saying vaccines cause autism and that cigarettes are harmless, but those studies were flawed and a few were retracted. It is important to 1) not let a single study trump the dozens of studies that contradict it, 2) not confuse opinion papers with actual science research, and 3) be sure that any study has valid controls, a large sample size, no conflict of interest (be it big-Agritech or big-Organic, both of which have millions to burn), and is otherwise scientifically sound.

14.0,"The only proven health issues with GMOs are possible allergic reactions. But those occur with non GMO foods too. The health and environmental benefits of GMO foods are substantial: higher nutrition levels, fewer inputs(fertilizer and pesticides) higher yields, longer season, wider range of growing areas, etc. I wii cite a couple of real, not theoretical, examples.In the western US the Pink Bollworm (PBW) is a big threat to cotton. It only feeds on cotton and okra, a close relative. The adult moth lays eggs on the cotton boll (fruiting structure that holds the seed and lint fibers) When the eggs hatch the larva (worm) eats its way into the boll, heading for the seed, which holds the protein it needs to survive. The worm is vulnerable to chemical control for 2–3 days, then it is too far into the boll to kill. Once the worm reaches the seed the boll, and lint is ruined. Some growers try to time spraying by trapping and counting the moth flights, picking the peak times to spray. You can never get all of the worms or moths unless you spray every night, which is cost prohibitive and environmentally un sound. A recent GMO discovery has for the most part solved this problem. Plant breeders have found way to “inject” cotton with a bacteria, Bacillus Thuringensis, into cotton. The seed of that inoculated cotton actually has the bacteria in it, which spreads throughout the plant as it grows. The PBW hatches and feeds on any part of the plant and it ingests the BT, which causes the worm to die. As a result 6 to 10 pesticide applications are eliminated. That means the cotton growing regions use thousands of pounds less pesticides every season. Did I mention the Bacillus Thuringensis is certified Organic?Another example of GMO benefits is Golden Rice. Some islands in the West Pacific Rim have been growing rice for generations with low levels of micronutrients. Beta Carotene- the orange in carrots- is needed in the diets of children aged 6 months to 10 years for Vitamin A production, which is responsible for eye development and general health. A million children die each year due to vitamin deficiencies and 500,000 children lose their eyesight due to lack of Vitamin A. After nine years of research Golden Rice emerged. It has higher levels of Beta Carotene in the grain kernals, so much so that it has an orange-gold color. Two cups of Golden Rice a day provides all of the Beta Carotene needed to maintain good eyesight That’s why your Mom kept saying “Eat your carrots, you’ve never seen a blind rabbit have you?”Golden Rice production and distribution has has been hampered by some governments who delay its use or stop it with excessive regulation. BT cotton has been criticized as being “dangerous” or a product of “Frankenfarming.” But GMO agriculture can lessen fertilizer, pesticide, or even water use. Genetically Modified plants can provide more food that is more nutrient laden, stays fresh longer, and is easier to transport.American researcher Norman Borlaug was the father of the first Green Revolution in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. During that time the world’s population grew by 100%, but food production grew by 150%, proving the 1700s economist Malthus terribly wrong, and the 1900s ag economist Boserup thankfully right.

8.0,"An important key to understanding why Europe and the United States have chosen to regulate identical technologies in such a dissimilar fashion has to do with recent changes in politics of risk regulation in Europe. From the 1960s through the mid 1980s, the regulation of health, safety and environmental risks was generally stricter in the United States than in Europe. Since the mid 1980s, the obverse has often been the case: a wide array of European consumer and environmental regulations, including those governing GMOs, are now more restrictive than in the United States. In a number of important respects, European regulatory politics and policies over the last fifteen years resemble those of the United States between the late 1960s and the mid 1980s. They are often politicized, highly contentious and characterized by a suspicion of science and a mistrust of both government and industry. By contrast, the US regulation of GMOs resembles the European regulatory style of the 1970s: regulators have worked cooperatively with industry and been supportive of technological innovation, while non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have enjoyed little access to the policy process.That was from a very comprehensive paper on the subject of why the EU regulates GMOs more than the U.S. In short it has more to to with politics and risk aversion than actual good science.Please read the full paper to understand this more fully.

11.0,"Absolutely organic means of production can easily supply enough food to support not only current population but many many more people too.Hunger has very little to do with lack of supply in Today\u2019s World. Usually it is a symptom of poverty or war. There is food available but some just can\u2019t get to the food because they either can\u2019t afford it or there are people with guns in the way blocking access.Organic production solves some of these problems because generally it takes more labor to produce high quality organic produce. Not always but quite often. More labor means jobs for those poor who can\u2019t afford food. Furthermore not only do they gain jobs, the farmer always takes their personal food off the top before selling the excess as a cash crop. So these will be well fed poor rather than starving poor.But the majority of the problem is due to agriculture purposely being wasteful in the industrial models of production.\In reality organic production models properly integrated with animals and crops in symbiosis would cause an explosion of high quality food worldwide. None need be starving. But organic production would not be able to supply some of the purposely wasteful industries industrial ag currently supplies now. For example currently the U.S. produces 14 billion + U.S. liquid gallons of ethanol fuel. This is primarily made from excess corn production beyond what is possible for every man woman and child in the world to ever eat. Organic production models don\u2019t need to purposely produce extra corn so as to purposely waste it making fuels that nobody wants anyway. It is ridiculously inefficient anyway. But it was designed that way on purpose. Simply a way for industry to purposely make money off inefficiency. It would all collapse tomorrow without multiple billions and billions in government subsidies paid for by you and me propping it up.Now instead of growing corn to make ethanol fuel additives, we allowed the great tallgrass prairies to return and raised our food on that instead? Huge increases in primary productivity so large that even taking a smaller % would still easily beat the industrial production models hands down. In fact the current subsidized production models are so inefficient, making that change would still even allow ethanol production off the excess grass! Strange as it may sound, ethanol production is so inefficient and takes so much energy to produce, even a smaller amount of grass produced ethanol would have by far more net gain in energy!Grass Makes Better Ethanol than Corn DoesAnd we know full well grass makes better beef! (If you are old enough to remember beef before feedlots) Not only just more better tasting beef per acre, but more nutritional as well.(unfortunately looks like hackers took down my best reference for health benefits, but luckily I have already posted most in long form on another Quora answer. So while all these Chico University links are now broken, you can find the citations the hard way)That leaves room for a return of wildlife as well!Grassland Birds: Fostering Habitats Using Rotational GrazingSo not only can organic feed more people, it can also rescue starving wildlife from extinction!But wait! \u2026.. There\u2019s more!Not only can organic production feed people better, provide jobs for the poor, make biofuels better, feed animals better and help wildlife better; it is also possible to mitigate man made global warming (AGW) too!Farming a climate change solutionCan we reverse global warming?In conclusion there is no reason preventing change to organic production systems worldwide excepting to feed the profits of a parasitic elite class that profit off the suffering of others. The big boys don\u2019t want the change and are doing everything in their power to prevent it. Why? Because they are not clever enough to profit from economies of abundance, having made all their profits from economies of scarcity. They are just not smart enough. Sorry but it is truth. Most the so called elites are really quite stupid, but have managed to rig the system in such a way as to stay on top by economic brute force and ignorance.\u201cI am an organic farmer.

The difference is that, Monsanto's test duration was merely 90 days, whereas Seralini study kept the experiment going for Two years.
This is the Seralini team's official website:GMO SeraliniHere is where they answer all criticism:Critics answeredLong story short, the French GMO study which linked GMOs to cancer in rats is valid, solid, and not 'debunked' as so many corporate outlets in USA claim - some of which immediately proceeded to 'debunk' the study even without one week passing from its publication.This example should illustrate what kind of political games and profits hang around the concept of GMOs.You can see what kind of pressure corporations have their governments exert from below example:EU dropped plans for safer pesticides after pressure from USYou can guess that it is no different in the case of GMO studies around the world.And yes, GMOs are banned in many countries:Twenty-Six Countries Ban GMOs—Why Won’t the US?The article asks, why doesn't US ban GMOs...The reason is simple and is a two word phrase: Monsanto Corporation.This is a massive corporation which does exorbitant profits based on GMOs. Incidentally, they are also the inventors and producers of Agent Orange chemical weapon, which USA used in Vietnam. And Aspartame artificial sweetener , which was linked to cancer itself.Aspartame controversyNow, the reason why such stuff are 'controversial' is solely because these corporations spend massive funds in order to do propaganda for their benefit. Like how they declared they were going to spend advertising money to combat 'global warming propaganda', and thus made global warming a 'controversial issue' in USA - not the rest of the world, or how energy saving light bulbs have become a 'cancerous, dangerous technology' in USA with same kind of advertising spending - to the extent that there is a strong segment of americans who think that incandescent lightbulbs are 'freedom' and they are 'safe'. While they pay ~70% more for the lighting they are using with incandescent bulbs.............GMOs actually pose a far greater danger than cancer risk or other health risks to individuals:Once a modified organism gets out into the wild and succeeds in reproducing, you can never take it back. Consider it like a virus.And you can never expect what the effects of such a rogue GMO will be in the wild in the broader ecosystems - on insects, other plants, and bigger animals and eventually entire ecosystems.To understand how big ecosystem damage can be, consider the case of big snakes (pythons) which had been released into the wild by pet owners from Florida when they grew too big:Florida Python Invasion: ‘No Going Back’ As Snake Population Spirals Out Of ControlThey are a plague now, totally changing the ecosystem by their presence. What will it end up in, no one can tell.This is despite they are NOT a genetically modified creature - they are totally normal, but we cant even take them back.GMOs are much more virulent. They are modified to not be able to produce by themselves in the wild. However, they can crossbreed with other organisms of their own species, and therefore you can never tell when one of the strains that you were putting in the wild will succeed in breaking away and changing maybe entire wold with no way to turn it back.And the effects of the combinations of the modified genes with whichever non modified member of their species they mate and breed outside the lab, is not known, and due to insane number of probabilities which span variations and future generations, will never be known.There is a reason why environmental organizations set up a seed bank in Norway to protect original, unmodified versions of our fauna and flora.Svalbard Global Seed Vault",2015-10-14T02:07:16.836Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1NTYyMzg1,27.0,5562385.0,Is GMO food really harmful to human health and banned in some developed countries like US?,https://www.quora.com/Is-GMO-food-really-harmful-to-human-health-and-banned-in-some-developed-countries-like-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44.0,"I’ll keep it relatively brief.I think the idea has merit, but in practice, GMOs have become a way for big companies to make a lot of money by encouraging farmers to grow their patented products, which show optimal performance typically in a chemically-intensive growing environment. And, not coincidentally, those chemicals are also sold by the companies which sell the patented seeds. Sure, that doesn’t describe all GMOs, but it does describe many. Feel free to peruse the approved varieties listed below.GM Approval Database- ISAAA.orgPeople will argue that GMOs are the answer to meeting food production demands for a growing global population. They say that current methods without GMOs won’t satisfy that demand after a point. I don’t think this is the right way to solve that problem — its like coming up with a drug to deal with the side-effects of another drug, but ignoring the original cause.What’s really going on is a degradation of soil as a natural resource as a result of conventional agriculture. Throwing more intensive conventional agriculture at the problem to circumvent the lowered output of a degraded resource will only further degrade that resource over time. The better answer would be to seek to replenish that resource — to rebuild soil. And the better way to do that is through no-till agriculture which integrates pastured livestock management and crop rotation.Here is a relatively short video of Gabe Brown giving a TedTalk on no-till agriculture.If you have the time for a much longer talk, which includes comparison of soil composition and testing, yields, water usage, etc., you’ll find others by searching on YouTube.no-till farming gabe brownBecause of the amount of information presented, these are considerably longer.These are real farmers using systems that rely less or not at all on costly chemical inputs — including fertilizer. Their production has gone up, and by integrating several revenue streams into their farming, they are able to get a lot more from their land than if they adopted conventional repeat-monocropping with chemical additions and patented seed. And while they’re at it, they’re rebuilding soil and sequestering carbon. To me, this is a better path than tweaking crops to be able to grow after being sprayed with herbicides.I’m not against all GMOs at all. I think there is much good that can come of this tool — the GMO virus-resistant papaya comes to mind, which can be grown where Papaya Ringspot Virus is prevalent and would otherwise make raising this crop impossible. So before anyone replies to this answer with “GMOs are safe” or “you’re anti-science” please just don’t bother. That’s not what my angst against some of them (i.e. herbicide-resistant crops) is about. I just don’t think they’re all they’re hyped to be, nor are they the solution I’d prefer. We don’t need to tweak crops to produce better in degraded soil — we need to replenish the soil.ETA — I keep trying to copy the video URL to start at the beginning, but it doesn’t seem to be working.

27.0,"Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.

I take the question to mean \regulations that require them to label food that contains GMO-derived ingredients?\I will focus on the United States, since that is where I am most familiar with the regulatory environment. Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do. Basically, the people who just claim that mandatory labeling laws would just \For those who insist on providing information to consumers, there is a way you can do this: label your own products the way you want, and don't force others to do so.

In many debates they are talking about intergenus genetic modification (of any process) especially those like Bt-Ready and Roundup-Ready. The anti-GMO debates tend to be mostly anti-Monsanto and focus on those types of modification.Some labeling laws have limited their scope to just this as well. Vermont's H.112 (Page on State) defines it as \The organic standard is a bit more direct: \Excluded methods. A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production.

I’m not picking on him; I generally find his content well-written and well-researched. But in this case, his answer is filled with misinformation and urban legend.For example, a common urban legend is that Monsanto sued farmers for accidental contamination, pursuing anyone with even a few stray plants in their fields so aggressively they bankrupted them.This story was invented by one man, a farmer in Indiana named Vernon Hugh Bowman. He collected soybean seeds from a grain elevator, planted them, then sprayed them with glyphosate to kill the ones that were not GM. He then planted his entire field with them.He tried claiming “accidental contamination” when he was sued, spinning a yarn that not even a jury of his peers believed. (Hint, when more than 95% of the plants on your farm are the same strain, that’s no accident, LOL.) He was convicted by a jury of his peers, but the story he spun stuck.I used to believe this story myself, just like Tomaž. Then someone challenged me to the same challenge I am about to make to Tomaž, and anyone else weho believes it:Name the farmers sued for this.All court cases in the US are public. If this happened, there should be plenty of examples. Cite cases. Name someone. You won’t be able to do it.In fact, Monsanto sent out people free of charge to clean out accidental contamination from any farmer who reported it.As for the “dangers” of glyphosate:Moreover, the company hid internal studies that showed their key moneymaking herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) wasn’t as safe as advertised. It was linked to an increase of cancer risk with gross overexposure.No.The overall incidence of cancer amongst people exposed to glyphosate is lower (yes, seriously!) than baseline.Lower. Not higher. Yes, seriously.The UN “study” that listed glyphosate as a “suspected carcinogen” is widely ridiculed in medical and scientific communities.So, why does this happen?$$$ money $$$Whenever you have a huge amount of money on the line, you will have a huge amount of money available for propaganda.People like to say Monsanto was this huge megacorporation. Actually, no, when it existed, it was kind of a pipsqueak.Organic foods, on the other hand, are an immense, fat-profit business. Sales of organic foods are more than triple Monsanto’s revenues.Organic food is huge, with much fatter profits than conventional or GM food, and organic food makers have poured billions of dollars over the yearsinto anti-GM propaganda—propaganda that well-meaning, otherwise intelligent people accept because it matches their bisaes and fears.I come to this from the position of a person who once believed as Tomaž and others do: Monsanto was an evil giant megacorporation, GM companies patented foods and that was bad, they bullied small farmers, and so on and so on.I started questioning that narrative when I started asking specific questions:How big is the GM food industry? How big is the organic food industry? Which is bigger?What farmers did Monsanto bully, specifically? What were their names? What were the case numbers? What farmers “lost their farms” because of Monsanto?

55.0,"No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.",2014-08-04T14:38:10.138Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyMjU0MTYx,7.0,2254161.0,Are genetically modified foods harmful to human health in the long run?,https://www.quora.com/Are-genetically-modified-foods-harmful-to-human-health-in-the-long-run,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

49.0,"Music.Music is what happens when a song is played -- either a performance or a recording of a performance. Music cannot be separated from the experience of listening to it in a way that can be owned.Recordings aren't even owned. They are licensed to you for limited uses by the copyright holders, in most cases, it'd the record label the artist has signed over their rights to.What we think of as the recordings we own on digital file, CD, phonograph, cassette, 8-track, or whatever -- these are merely containers for the recordings. We own the containers, but we do not own the recordings contained within them.It all boils down to this: what we think of as ownership of music is actually us paying for the right to access the music. In a world where the technological cost of providing global access to the entire history of recorded music is easily covered by charging a small fee or tax for access, the idea of music ownership will and should be considered anachronistic. Music is free. What we pay for is access.Of course, musicians need some sort of fair compensation to stimulate the production of music. This is the purpose of copyright in the first place. But musicians have never been fairly compensated for their music. Over the last few centuries, a microscopic minority of musicians became wealthy, while the music industry itself grew to a multibillion dollar enterprise. Increasingly, copyright is used by corporations to stifle technological innovation the maintain the status quo of musician exploitation and the lie of musical ownership. Prior to the invention of the recording, music could only be generated through a performance. There had to be musicians playing within earshot in order for one to experience music. Or, you had to play the song yourself. The economics were simple -- musicians enjoyed the support of their patrons, and later, the public became patron as live music flourished. The recording -- and the concept of music ownership -- shut down much of this burgeoning live music scene. The great irony is that after the recording dominated 20th century music, the 21st century brought the disruption of digital distribution, causing us to give new value the live performance and viewing the recording for what it really is -- a facsimile of a single performance. As such, we have a new generation of listeners and musicians that recognize music ownership is a capitalist illusion, access to music should be free like tap water (which we perceive as free but in reality is paid for as a utility), and live performance should be held up as the ultimate authentic music experience. This is why the concert industry is booming and record sales are plummeting.",2013-03-18T21:27:06.892Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxMDMzMTg3,10.0,1033187.0,"What are things people think they own, but they actually don't (e.g. a mortgaged home, software, GMO seeds)?",https://www.quora.com/What-are-things-people-think-they-own-but-they-actually-dont-e-g-a-mortgaged-home-software-GMO-seeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

29.0,"A genetically modified organism, is simply an organism who’s genes has been modified, as a result of human intervention by performing genetic engineering. This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is! And how/what’s that? We take the gene, that acts like a blueprint on how to make this hormone, from a healthy person. We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin. Soon, you have thousands of bacteria producing this hormone, and the quantity and quality of this insulin is good enough to become an economically viable manufacturing process, and that’s how you get insulin these days.So who was the GMO here? It was the bacteria. You manipulated the genetic material of the bacteria, so that it produced more insulin, which was for your own benefit, and made medicine cheaper.By the way, which kind of egg do you have?",2016-01-27T16:35:36.742Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo2NzMyNzY1,12.0,6732765.0,What is a genetically modified organism (GMO)?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-genetically-modified-organism-GMO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

28.0,"I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control. This is not product that is being sold to help American families.The link below was deleted by the magazine after sharing. Here is the backup.China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be Buying (deleted after sharing)China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be BuyingThe Snack Food and Corn Syrup Lobbyist Shaping Guidelines for AmericansIf you’re consuming mostly genetically modified organisms into your diet, it means that you are not cooking your food from scratch. Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day.

17.0,"Neither in my opinion. Is the farmer a knowledgeable and honest grower? That’s the question of importance.Organic means that it has been grown without the application of synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. However, this does not prohibit the farmer from applying natural pesticides (pyrethrines) at high concentrations too close to harvest or applying manure from animals that were given high doses of antibiotics.The responsibility of what is good or not lies with the farmer. Not the product.If you follow the instructions of how to properly grow a crop from an agronomist it does not matter, which method or seed you use; organic or conventional farming, non-gmo or gmo. There are no nutritional differences measured from either type of crop cultivation. Flavor-wise it is better to buy from a farmer’s market than a supermarket, where they harvest immature vegetables and fruits, but nutritionally they are almost identical as well.Non-GMOs means that the product has been produced through traditional breeding methods which is a very long procedure (10–15 years). GMOs could have a disease resistance or drought resistance gene inside them from a related species or not, etc. This has absolutely no effect on you, unless we are talking about a toxin introduced into the plant, which companies avoid anyway doing that. Companies do not want dead or ill consumers. They want hungry and healthy consumers to keep buying their products. Period.So, to answer your question:I would consider more important Organic vs non-organic, although there is no practical difference between them for you. I just expect that Organic farmers would be more diligent as small-scale farmers about their concern for your food. GMOs vs non-GMOs just does not matter.Personally I would choose the farmer first and then my products.",2018-11-11T02:35:12.378Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozNzIyOTY5Ng==,16.0,37229696.0,What’s more important: organic or non-gmo?,https://www.quora.com/What-s-more-important-organic-or-non-gmo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soybeans. Cotton. Canola ( rapeseed). Alfalfa. There's more, but these will do fine for what we are talking about.\n \nNow we need to separate the crops into 2 subsets. Those crops that are self pollinated and those that are outcrossers. Selfers are plants that pollinate themselves by having the pollen drop into the stigma of the flower without needing outside help, like an insect or the wind, thus ensuring a tomato, or a chile pepper, or a wheat kernel. \n \n \nOutcrossers need help to spread pollen. That head of broccoli needed mostly bees to help create it, or that ear of corn needed some strong wind to spread pollen.\n \nOk. So. Selfers- Soybeans. Cotton. \n \nOutcrossers.- Corn. Canola. Alfalfa. \n \nCrops that are selfers don't suffer from inbreeding depression, a term that means they lose their viability over time from having too little genetic diversity during the growing season. So saving seed from one tomato plant, one wheat plant, one bean plant is fine. That seed can be grown and resaved for a lifetime.\n \nOutcrossers aren't like that. They need lot's of genetic diversity, which to the farmer means they  grow a lot of plants. One broccoli plant? No way. One carrot plant, one corn plant, one canola plant? No. Think at least 500 to start, and no less than 100 to finish. They need pollination from a large population of plants. Without this, the seed is very poor, genetically bottlenecked and usually unfit for next generational use. \n \nOk?\n \nNow let's further separate these crops into 2 types.

13.0,"I have trouble with the terminology, but the concepts are clear.GMO, or genetically modified organisms, are the essence of agriculture. For thousands of years, farmers, agronomists, plant scientists have used plant and animal breeding to manipulate the genetic makeup of the foods we eat. That is a good thing.However, GMOs as they are developed today, uses recombinant DNA manipulation to alter the attributes of the plants. As a result, it is possible to introduce changes that we would never see in nature (i.e. introduction of animal characteristics into plant material). While that’s not necessarily bad, we also greatly reduce the time it takes to see the changes in the material, and therefore we can’t fully investigate the unintended consequences of our manipulations. Every technological innovation has risks of unintended consequences, but genetic manipulation can have broad, catastrophic impacts. It’s kind of like nuclear power generation: it’s a great thing when everything is fine, and failure may be very rare, but the impacts can be huge. I advocate continuing research, but proceeding slowly. I also believe in detailed labelling to enable consumers to make their own choices.Organic foods fall into a different category. The term “organic” is meaningless and requires significant explanation in order to be useful for consumers. I do not believe that inorganic fertilizers are “bad” and I do not believe that all herbicides and pesticides are bad. Again, it’s a matter of really looking into the specific practices of cultivation. That’s one reason why I do agree with buying from local producers: the consumer has the ability to find out exactly how something was produced and to talk to the producer.",2016-03-25T20:32:50.899Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo3NDkyODY5,18.0,7492869.0,What is your opinion of GMO and organic foods?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-of-GMO-and-organic-foods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies existed saying vaccines cause autism and that cigarettes are harmless, but those studies were flawed and a few were retracted.

14.0,"The only proven health issues with GMOs are possible allergic reactions. But those occur with non GMO foods too. The health and environmental benefits of GMO foods are substantial: higher nutrition levels, fewer inputs(fertilizer and pesticides) higher yields, longer season, wider range of growing areas, etc. I wii cite a couple of real, not theoretical, examples.In the western US the Pink Bollworm (PBW) is a big threat to cotton. It only feeds on cotton and okra, a close relative. The adult moth lays eggs on the cotton boll (fruiting structure that holds the seed and lint fibers) When the eggs hatch the larva (worm) eats its way into the boll, heading for the seed, which holds the protein it needs to survive. The worm is vulnerable to chemical control for 2–3 days, then it is too far into the boll to kill. Once the worm reaches the seed the boll, and lint is ruined. Some growers try to time spraying by trapping and counting the moth flights, picking the peak times to spray. You can never get all of the worms or moths unless you spray every night, which is cost prohibitive and environmentally un sound. A recent GMO discovery has for the most part solved this problem. Plant breeders have found way to “inject” cotton with a bacteria, Bacillus Thuringensis, into cotton. The seed of that inoculated cotton actually has the bacteria in it, which spreads throughout the plant as it grows. The PBW hatches and feeds on any part of the plant and it ingests the BT, which causes the worm to die. As a result 6 to 10 pesticide applications are eliminated. That means the cotton growing regions use thousands of pounds less pesticides every season. Did I mention the Bacillus Thuringensis is certified Organic?Another example of GMO benefits is Golden Rice. Some islands in the West Pacific Rim have been growing rice for generations with low levels of micronutrients. Beta Carotene- the orange in carrots- is needed in the diets of children aged 6 months to 10 years for Vitamin A production, which is responsible for eye development and general health. A million children die each year due to vitamin deficiencies and 500,000 children lose their eyesight due to lack of Vitamin A. After nine years of research Golden Rice emerged. It has higher levels of Beta Carotene in the grain kernals, so much so that it has an orange-gold color. Two cups of Golden Rice a day provides all of the Beta Carotene needed to maintain good eyesight That’s why your Mom kept saying “Eat your carrots, you’ve never seen a blind rabbit have you?”Golden Rice production and distribution has has been hampered by some governments who delay its use or stop it with excessive regulation. BT cotton has been criticized as being “dangerous” or a product of “Frankenfarming.” But GMO agriculture can lessen fertilizer, pesticide, or even water use. Genetically Modified plants can provide more food that is more nutrient laden, stays fresh longer, and is easier to transport.American researcher Norman Borlaug was the father of the first Green Revolution in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.

8.0,"An important key to understanding why Europe and the United States have chosen to regulate identical technologies in such a dissimilar fashion has to do with recent changes in politics of risk regulation in Europe. From the 1960s through the mid 1980s, the regulation of health, safety and environmental risks was generally stricter in the United States than in Europe. Since the mid 1980s, the obverse has often been the case: a wide array of European consumer and environmental regulations, including those governing GMOs, are now more restrictive than in the United States. In a number of important respects, European regulatory politics and policies over the last fifteen years resemble those of the United States between the late 1960s and the mid 1980s. They are often politicized, highly contentious and characterized by a suspicion of science and a mistrust of both government and industry. By contrast, the US regulation of GMOs resembles the European regulatory style of the 1970s: regulators have worked cooperatively with industry and been supportive of technological innovation, while non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have enjoyed little access to the policy process.That was from a very comprehensive paper on the subject of why the EU regulates GMOs more than the U.S. In short it has more to to with politics and risk aversion than actual good science.Please read the full paper to understand this more fully. Please follow my link.The Regulation of GMOs in Europe and the United States: A Case-Study of Contemporary European Regulatory PoliticsIn other words, most GMO bans or regulations are politically motivated and have nothing to do with science.What do most of the world’s scientific organizations have to say about it, including European.AAASThe American Association for the Advancement of Science is an international non-profit organization and serves some 261 affiliated societies and academies of science.“The science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe”.AMAThe premier body of physicians in the United States.“There is no scientific justification for special labeling of genetically modified foods.Bioengineered foods have been consumed for close to 20 years, and during that time, no overt consequences on human health have been reported and/or substantiated in the peer-reviewed literature.”WHOThe World Health Organization (WHO) is the direction and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.“No effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of GM foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved.ECThe European Commission (EC) is the executive body of the European Union“The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs are no more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.”NASThe National Academy of Sciences is a non-profit organization in the United Staes.

11.0,"Absolutely organic means of production can easily supply enough food to support not only current population but many many more people too.Hunger has very little to do with lack of supply in Today\u2019s World. Usually it is a symptom of poverty or war. There is food available but some just can\u2019t get to the food because they either can\u2019t afford it or there are people with guns in the way blocking access.Organic production solves some of these problems because generally it takes more labor to produce high quality organic produce. Not always but quite often. More labor means jobs for those poor who can\u2019t afford food. Furthermore not only do they gain jobs, the farmer always takes their personal food off the top before selling the excess as a cash crop. So these will be well fed poor rather than starving poor.But the majority of the problem is due to agriculture purposely being wasteful in the industrial models of production.\In reality organic production models properly integrated with animals and crops in symbiosis would cause an explosion of high quality food worldwide. None need be starving. But organic production would not be able to supply some of the purposely wasteful industries industrial ag currently supplies now. For example currently the U.S. produces 14 billion + U.S. liquid gallons of ethanol fuel. This is primarily made from excess corn production beyond what is possible for every man woman and child in the world to ever eat. Organic production models don\u2019t need to purposely produce extra corn so as to purposely waste it making fuels that nobody wants anyway. It is ridiculously inefficient anyway. But it was designed that way on purpose. Simply a way for industry to purposely make money off inefficiency. It would all collapse tomorrow without multiple billions and billions in government subsidies paid for by you and me propping it up.Now instead of growing corn to make ethanol fuel additives, we allowed the great tallgrass prairies to return and raised our food on that instead? Huge increases in primary productivity so large that even taking a smaller % would still easily beat the industrial production models hands down. In fact the current subsidized production models are so inefficient, making that change would still even allow ethanol production off the excess grass! Strange as it may sound, ethanol production is so inefficient and takes so much energy to produce, even a smaller amount of grass produced ethanol would have by far more net gain in energy!Grass Makes Better Ethanol than Corn DoesAnd we know full well grass makes better beef! (If you are old enough to remember beef before feedlots) Not only just more better tasting beef per acre, but more nutritional as well.(unfortunately looks like hackers took down my best reference for health benefits, but luckily I have already posted most in long form on another Quora answer. So while all these Chico University links are now broken, you can find the citations the hard way)That leaves room for a return of wildlife as well!Grassland Birds: Fostering Habitats Using Rotational GrazingSo not only can organic feed more people, it can also rescue starving wildlife from extinction!But wait! \u2026..

The big boys don\u2019t want the change and are doing everything in their power to prevent it. Why? Because they are not clever enough to profit from economies of abundance, having made all their profits from economies of scarcity. They are just not smart enough. Sorry but it is truth.

11.0,"There are strong studies which linked GMOs to harmful effects, including cancer.This famous French study was first dropped from the journal due to pressure and lobbying from Monsanto corporation and other american interests, but when its researchers sued the journal in the court and won on grounds that the research and its data was scientifically solid and viable, it was republished by the very same journal that dropped it upon pressure, by court order.Page on the-scientist.comThis study - Seralini Study - basically repeated the exact experiment Monsanto corporation used to vouch for the safety of its GMOs. The difference is that, Monsanto's test duration was merely 90 days, whereas Seralini study kept the experiment going for Two years.
This is the Seralini team's official website:GMO SeraliniHere is where they answer all criticism:Critics answeredLong story short, the French GMO study which linked GMOs to cancer in rats is valid, solid, and not 'debunked' as so many corporate outlets in USA claim - some of which immediately proceeded to 'debunk' the study even without one week passing from its publication.This example should illustrate what kind of political games and profits hang around the concept of GMOs.You can see what kind of pressure corporations have their governments exert from below example:EU dropped plans for safer pesticides after pressure from USYou can guess that it is no different in the case of GMO studies around the world.And yes, GMOs are banned in many countries:Twenty-Six Countries Ban GMOs—Why Won’t the US?The article asks, why doesn't US ban GMOs...The reason is simple and is a two word phrase: Monsanto Corporation.This is a massive corporation which does exorbitant profits based on GMOs. Incidentally, they are also the inventors and producers of Agent Orange chemical weapon, which USA used in Vietnam. And Aspartame artificial sweetener , which was linked to cancer itself.Aspartame controversyNow, the reason why such stuff are 'controversial' is solely because these corporations spend massive funds in order to do propaganda for their benefit. Like how they declared they were going to spend advertising money to combat 'global warming propaganda', and thus made global warming a 'controversial issue' in USA - not the rest of the world, or how energy saving light bulbs have become a 'cancerous, dangerous technology' in USA with same kind of advertising spending - to the extent that there is a strong segment of americans who think that incandescent lightbulbs are 'freedom' and they are 'safe'. While they pay ~70% more for the lighting they are using with incandescent bulbs.............GMOs actually pose a far greater danger than cancer risk or other health risks to individuals:Once a modified organism gets out into the wild and succeeds in reproducing, you can never take it back. Consider it like a virus.And you can never expect what the effects of such a rogue GMO will be in the wild in the broader ecosystems - on insects, other plants, and bigger animals and eventually entire ecosystems.To understand how big ecosystem damage can be, consider the case of big snakes (pythons) which had been released into the wild by pet owners from Florida when they grew too big:Florida Python Invasion: ‘No Going Back’ As Snake Population Spirals Out Of ControlThey are a plague now, totally changing the ecosystem by their presence. What will it end up in, no one can tell.This is despite they are NOT a genetically modified creature - they are totally normal, but we cant even take them back.GMOs are much more virulent. They are modified to not be able to produce by themselves in the wild. However, they can crossbreed with other organisms of their own species, and therefore you can never tell when one of the strains that you were putting in the wild will succeed in breaking away and changing maybe entire wold with no way to turn it back.And the effects of the combinations of the modified genes with whichever non modified member of their species they mate and breed outside the lab, is not known, and due to insane number of probabilities which span variations and future generations, will never be known.There is a reason why environmental organizations set up a seed bank in Norway to protect original, unmodified versions of our fauna and flora.Svalbard Global Seed Vault",2015-10-14T02:07:16.836Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1NTYyMzg1,27.0,5562385.0,Is GMO food really harmful to human health and banned in some developed countries like US?,https://www.quora.com/Is-GMO-food-really-harmful-to-human-health-and-banned-in-some-developed-countries-like-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44.0,"I’ll keep it relatively brief.I think the idea has merit, but in practice, GMOs have become a way for big companies to make a lot of money by encouraging farmers to grow their patented products, which show optimal performance typically in a chemically-intensive growing environment. And, not coincidentally, those chemicals are also sold by the companies which sell the patented seeds. Sure, that doesn’t describe all GMOs, but it does describe many. Feel free to peruse the approved varieties listed below.GM Approval Database- ISAAA.orgPeople will argue that GMOs are the answer to meeting food production demands for a growing global population. They say that current methods without GMOs won’t satisfy that demand after a point. I don’t think this is the right way to solve that problem — its like coming up with a drug to deal with the side-effects of another drug, but ignoring the original cause.What’s really going on is a degradation of soil as a natural resource as a result of conventional agriculture. Throwing more intensive conventional agriculture at the problem to circumvent the lowered output of a degraded resource will only further degrade that resource over time. The better answer would be to seek to replenish that resource — to rebuild soil. And the better way to do that is through no-till agriculture which integrates pastured livestock management and crop rotation.Here is a relatively short video of Gabe Brown giving a TedTalk on no-till agriculture.If you have the time for a much longer talk, which includes comparison of soil composition and testing, yields, water usage, etc., you’ll find others by searching on YouTube.no-till farming gabe brownBecause of the amount of information presented, these are considerably longer.These are real farmers using systems that rely less or not at all on costly chemical inputs — including fertilizer. Their production has gone up, and by integrating several revenue streams into their farming, they are able to get a lot more from their land than if they adopted conventional repeat-monocropping with chemical additions and patented seed. And while they’re at it, they’re rebuilding soil and sequestering carbon. To me, this is a better path than tweaking crops to be able to grow after being sprayed with herbicides.I’m not against all GMOs at all. I think there is much good that can come of this tool — the GMO virus-resistant papaya comes to mind, which can be grown where Papaya Ringspot Virus is prevalent and would otherwise make raising this crop impossible. So before anyone replies to this answer with “GMOs are safe” or “you’re anti-science” please just don’t bother. That’s not what my angst against some of them (i.e. herbicide-resistant crops) is about. I just don’t think they’re all they’re hyped to be, nor are they the solution I’d prefer. We don’t need to tweak crops to produce better in degraded soil — we need to replenish the soil.ETA — I keep trying to copy the video URL to start at the beginning, but it doesn’t seem to be working.

27.0,"Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.

Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do.

I’m not picking on him; I generally find his content well-written and well-researched. But in this case, his answer is filled with misinformation and urban legend.For example, a common urban legend is that Monsanto sued farmers for accidental contamination, pursuing anyone with even a few stray plants in their fields so aggressively they bankrupted them.This story was invented by one man, a farmer in Indiana named Vernon Hugh Bowman. He collected soybean seeds from a grain elevator, planted them, then sprayed them with glyphosate to kill the ones that were not GM. He then planted his entire field with them.He tried claiming “accidental contamination” when he was sued, spinning a yarn that not even a jury of his peers believed. (Hint, when more than 95% of the plants on your farm are the same strain, that’s no accident, LOL.) He was convicted by a jury of his peers, but the story he spun stuck.I used to believe this story myself, just like Tomaž.

You won’t be able to do it.In fact, Monsanto sent out people free of charge to clean out accidental contamination from any farmer who reported it.As for the “dangers” of glyphosate:Moreover, the company hid internal studies that showed their key moneymaking herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) wasn’t as safe as advertised. It was linked to an increase of cancer risk with gross overexposure.No.The overall incidence of cancer amongst people exposed to glyphosate is lower (yes, seriously!) than baseline.Lower. Not higher. Yes, seriously.The UN “study” that listed glyphosate as a “suspected carcinogen” is widely ridiculed in medical and scientific communities.So, why does this happen?$$$ money $$$Whenever you have a huge amount of money on the line, you will have a huge amount of money available for propaganda.People like to say Monsanto was this huge megacorporation. Actually, no, when it existed, it was kind of a pipsqueak.Organic foods, on the other hand, are an immense, fat-profit business. Sales of organic foods are more than triple Monsanto’s revenues.Organic food is huge, with much fatter profits than conventional or GM food, and organic food makers have poured billions of dollars over the yearsinto anti-GM propaganda—propaganda that well-meaning, otherwise intelligent people accept because it matches their bisaes and fears.I come to this from the position of a person who once believed as Tomaž and others do: Monsanto was an evil giant megacorporation, GM companies patented foods and that was bad, they bullied small farmers, and so on and so on.I started questioning that narrative when I started asking specific questions:How big is the GM food industry? How big is the organic food industry? Which is bigger?What farmers did Monsanto bully, specifically? What were their names? What were the case numbers? What farmers “lost their farms” because of Monsanto? Who were they?If GM food is bad because of food patents, then why did the first food patents get issued in the 1800s, before genetic engineering was a thing? Why are organic foods patented? (Spoilter: Yes, organic and conventional foods are also patented! Surprise! It’s amazing how many people legitimately don’t know this.)Once you start down these rabbit holes, you end up in a very different place than you started from.Why are so many people opposed to GM food?

55.0,"No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.",2014-08-04T14:38:10.138Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyMjU0MTYx,7.0,2254161.0,Are genetically modified foods harmful to human health in the long run?,https://www.quora.com/Are-genetically-modified-foods-harmful-to-human-health-in-the-long-run,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28.0,"Well, it is a topic on which a long debate could be done on.As being a biotechnologist (pursing undergraduate course in biotech), my views are as follows:A variety of GM crops are being harvested in various parts of the world and many are still being worked on. The best part of GM crops is their high yield, good nutritional quality, a good shelf life, could be harvested in lesser time than the normal ones and the point of my interest- could be used to make edible vaccines (would'nt it be great- nutrition and vaccination all in a single shot- could be quite handy for poor countries and UN). Now on to the GM organisms. Till now, I have not known to any GMO. But I still know that they are being worked on.

49.0,"Music.Music is what happens when a song is played -- either a performance or a recording of a performance. Music cannot be separated from the experience of listening to it in a way that can be owned.Recordings aren't even owned. They are licensed to you for limited uses by the copyright holders, in most cases, it'd the record label the artist has signed over their rights to.What we think of as the recordings we own on digital file, CD, phonograph, cassette, 8-track, or whatever -- these are merely containers for the recordings. We own the containers, but we do not own the recordings contained within them.It all boils down to this: what we think of as ownership of music is actually us paying for the right to access the music. In a world where the technological cost of providing global access to the entire history of recorded music is easily covered by charging a small fee or tax for access, the idea of music ownership will and should be considered anachronistic. Music is free. What we pay for is access.Of course, musicians need some sort of fair compensation to stimulate the production of music. This is the purpose of copyright in the first place. But musicians have never been fairly compensated for their music. Over the last few centuries, a microscopic minority of musicians became wealthy, while the music industry itself grew to a multibillion dollar enterprise. Increasingly, copyright is used by corporations to stifle technological innovation the maintain the status quo of musician exploitation and the lie of musical ownership. Prior to the invention of the recording, music could only be generated through a performance. There had to be musicians playing within earshot in order for one to experience music. Or, you had to play the song yourself. The economics were simple -- musicians enjoyed the support of their patrons, and later, the public became patron as live music flourished. The recording -- and the concept of music ownership -- shut down much of this burgeoning live music scene. The great irony is that after the recording dominated 20th century music, the 21st century brought the disruption of digital distribution, causing us to give new value the live performance and viewing the recording for what it really is -- a facsimile of a single performance. As such, we have a new generation of listeners and musicians that recognize music ownership is a capitalist illusion, access to music should be free like tap water (which we perceive as free but in reality is paid for as a utility), and live performance should be held up as the ultimate authentic music experience. This is why the concert industry is booming and record sales are plummeting.",2013-03-18T21:27:06.892Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxMDMzMTg3,10.0,1033187.0,"What are things people think they own, but they actually don't (e.g. a mortgaged home, software, GMO seeds)?",https://www.quora.com/What-are-things-people-think-they-own-but-they-actually-dont-e-g-a-mortgaged-home-software-GMO-seeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

29.0,"A genetically modified organism, is simply an organism who’s genes has been modified, as a result of human intervention by performing genetic engineering. This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is! And how/what’s that? We take the gene, that acts like a blueprint on how to make this hormone, from a healthy person. We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin. Soon, you have thousands of bacteria producing this hormone, and the quantity and quality of this insulin is good enough to become an economically viable manufacturing process, and that’s how you get insulin these days.So who was the GMO here? It was the bacteria. You manipulated the genetic material of the bacteria, so that it produced more insulin, which was for your own benefit, and made medicine cheaper.By the way, which kind of egg do you have?",2016-01-27T16:35:36.742Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo2NzMyNzY1,12.0,6732765.0,What is a genetically modified organism (GMO)?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-genetically-modified-organism-GMO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

28.0,"I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control. This is not product that is being sold to help American families.The link below was deleted by the magazine after sharing. Here is the backup.China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be Buying (deleted after sharing)China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be BuyingThe Snack Food and Corn Syrup Lobbyist Shaping Guidelines for AmericansIf you’re consuming mostly genetically modified organisms into your diet, it means that you are not cooking your food from scratch. Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day.

17.0,"Neither in my opinion. Is the farmer a knowledgeable and honest grower? That’s the question of importance.Organic means that it has been grown without the application of synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. However, this does not prohibit the farmer from applying natural pesticides (pyrethrines) at high concentrations too close to harvest or applying manure from animals that were given high doses of antibiotics.The responsibility of what is good or not lies with the farmer. Not the product.If you follow the instructions of how to properly grow a crop from an agronomist it does not matter, which method or seed you use; organic or conventional farming, non-gmo or gmo. There are no nutritional differences measured from either type of crop cultivation. Flavor-wise it is better to buy from a farmer’s market than a supermarket, where they harvest immature vegetables and fruits, but nutritionally they are almost identical as well.Non-GMOs means that the product has been produced through traditional breeding methods which is a very long procedure (10–15 years). GMOs could have a disease resistance or drought resistance gene inside them from a related species or not, etc. This has absolutely no effect on you, unless we are talking about a toxin introduced into the plant, which companies avoid anyway doing that. Companies do not want dead or ill consumers. They want hungry and healthy consumers to keep buying their products. Period.So, to answer your question:I would consider more important Organic vs non-organic, although there is no practical difference between them for you. I just expect that Organic farmers would be more diligent as small-scale farmers about their concern for your food. GMOs vs non-GMOs just does not matter.Personally I would choose the farmer first and then my products.",2018-11-11T02:35:12.378Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozNzIyOTY5Ng==,16.0,37229696.0,What’s more important: organic or non-gmo?,https://www.quora.com/What-s-more-important-organic-or-non-gmo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13.0,"I have trouble with the terminology, but the concepts are clear.GMO, or genetically modified organisms, are the essence of agriculture. For thousands of years, farmers, agronomists, plant scientists have used plant and animal breeding to manipulate the genetic makeup of the foods we eat. That is a good thing.However, GMOs as they are developed today, uses recombinant DNA manipulation to alter the attributes of the plants. As a result, it is possible to introduce changes that we would never see in nature (i.e. introduction of animal characteristics into plant material). While that’s not necessarily bad, we also greatly reduce the time it takes to see the changes in the material, and therefore we can’t fully investigate the unintended consequences of our manipulations. Every technological innovation has risks of unintended consequences, but genetic manipulation can have broad, catastrophic impacts. It’s kind of like nuclear power generation: it’s a great thing when everything is fine, and failure may be very rare, but the impacts can be huge. I advocate continuing research, but proceeding slowly. I also believe in detailed labelling to enable consumers to make their own choices.Organic foods fall into a different category. The term “organic” is meaningless and requires significant explanation in order to be useful for consumers. I do not believe that inorganic fertilizers are “bad” and I do not believe that all herbicides and pesticides are bad. Again, it’s a matter of really looking into the specific practices of cultivation. That’s one reason why I do agree with buying from local producers: the consumer has the ability to find out exactly how something was produced and to talk to the producer.",2016-03-25T20:32:50.899Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo3NDkyODY5,17.0,7492869.0,What is your opinion of GMO and organic foods?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-of-GMO-and-organic-foods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soybeans. Cotton. Canola ( rapeseed). Alfalfa. There's more, but these will do fine for what we are talking about.\n \nNow we need to separate the crops into 2 subsets. Those crops that are self pollinated and those that are outcrossers. Selfers are plants that pollinate themselves by having the pollen drop into the stigma of the flower without needing outside help, like an insect or the wind, thus ensuring a tomato, or a chile pepper, or a wheat kernel. \n \n \nOutcrossers need help to spread pollen. That head of broccoli needed mostly bees to help create it, or that ear of corn needed some strong wind to spread pollen.\n \nOk. So. Selfers- Soybeans. Cotton. \n \nOutcrossers.- Corn. Canola. Alfalfa. \n \nCrops that are selfers don't suffer from inbreeding depression, a term that means they lose their viability over time from having too little genetic diversity during the growing season. So saving seed from one tomato plant, one wheat plant, one bean plant is fine. That seed can be grown and resaved for a lifetime.\n \nOutcrossers aren't like that. They need lot's of genetic diversity, which to the farmer means they  grow a lot of plants. One broccoli plant? No way. One carrot plant, one corn plant, one canola plant? No. Think at least 500 to start, and no less than 100 to finish. They need pollination from a large population of plants. Without this, the seed is very poor, genetically bottlenecked and usually unfit for next generational use. \n \nOk?\n \nNow let's further separate these crops into 2 types.

In fact, there's a list: Studies with independent fundingThe conclusions are clear: no negative effects. GMO's are just as nutritious as non-GMO's (except when they are designed to be even more nutritious, like Golden Rice) and cause no health problems. Here is a literature review of these results, and another assessment of GE food safety here.Note that studies do exist saying GMO's are bad… but you asked for good ones. Studies existed saying vaccines cause autism and that cigarettes are harmless, but those studies were flawed and a few were retracted. It is important to 1) not let a single study trump the dozens of studies that contradict it, 2) not confuse opinion papers with actual science research, and 3) be sure that any study has valid controls, a large sample size, no conflict of interest (be it big-Agritech or big-Organic, both of which have millions to burn), and is otherwise scientifically sound. A study that tried to show GMO corn gives rats cancer, for example, was debunked when scientists pointed out they used cancer-prone rats in the study, who would have gotten sick even if they were fed organic food, or nothing at all.Ultimately, while political and economic opposition to GMO's may be valid, the science is clear that they are safe.

14.0,"The only proven health issues with GMOs are possible allergic reactions. But those occur with non GMO foods too. The health and environmental benefits of GMO foods are substantial: higher nutrition levels, fewer inputs(fertilizer and pesticides) higher yields, longer season, wider range of growing areas, etc. I wii cite a couple of real, not theoretical, examples.In the western US the Pink Bollworm (PBW) is a big threat to cotton. It only feeds on cotton and okra, a close relative. The adult moth lays eggs on the cotton boll (fruiting structure that holds the seed and lint fibers) When the eggs hatch the larva (worm) eats its way into the boll, heading for the seed, which holds the protein it needs to survive. The worm is vulnerable to chemical control for 2–3 days, then it is too far into the boll to kill. Once the worm reaches the seed the boll, and lint is ruined. Some growers try to time spraying by trapping and counting the moth flights, picking the peak times to spray. You can never get all of the worms or moths unless you spray every night, which is cost prohibitive and environmentally un sound. A recent GMO discovery has for the most part solved this problem. Plant breeders have found way to “inject” cotton with a bacteria, Bacillus Thuringensis, into cotton. The seed of that inoculated cotton actually has the bacteria in it, which spreads throughout the plant as it grows. The PBW hatches and feeds on any part of the plant and it ingests the BT, which causes the worm to die. As a result 6 to 10 pesticide applications are eliminated. That means the cotton growing regions use thousands of pounds less pesticides every season. Did I mention the Bacillus Thuringensis is certified Organic?Another example of GMO benefits is Golden Rice. Some islands in the West Pacific Rim have been growing rice for generations with low levels of micronutrients. Beta Carotene- the orange in carrots- is needed in the diets of children aged 6 months to 10 years for Vitamin A production, which is responsible for eye development and general health. A million children die each year due to vitamin deficiencies and 500,000 children lose their eyesight due to lack of Vitamin A. After nine years of research Golden Rice emerged. It has higher levels of Beta Carotene in the grain kernals, so much so that it has an orange-gold color. Two cups of Golden Rice a day provides all of the Beta Carotene needed to maintain good eyesight That’s why your Mom kept saying “Eat your carrots, you’ve never seen a blind rabbit have you?”Golden Rice production and distribution has has been hampered by some governments who delay its use or stop it with excessive regulation. BT cotton has been criticized as being “dangerous” or a product of “Frankenfarming.” But GMO agriculture can lessen fertilizer, pesticide, or even water use. Genetically Modified plants can provide more food that is more nutrient laden, stays fresh longer, and is easier to transport.American researcher Norman Borlaug was the father of the first Green Revolution in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. During that time the world’s population grew by 100%, but food production grew by 150%, proving the 1700s economist Malthus terribly wrong, and the 1900s ag economist Boserup thankfully right.

8.0,"An important key to understanding why Europe and the United States have chosen to regulate identical technologies in such a dissimilar fashion has to do with recent changes in politics of risk regulation in Europe. From the 1960s through the mid 1980s, the regulation of health, safety and environmental risks was generally stricter in the United States than in Europe. Since the mid 1980s, the obverse has often been the case: a wide array of European consumer and environmental regulations, including those governing GMOs, are now more restrictive than in the United States. In a number of important respects, European regulatory politics and policies over the last fifteen years resemble those of the United States between the late 1960s and the mid 1980s. They are often politicized, highly contentious and characterized by a suspicion of science and a mistrust of both government and industry. By contrast, the US regulation of GMOs resembles the European regulatory style of the 1970s: regulators have worked cooperatively with industry and been supportive of technological innovation, while non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have enjoyed little access to the policy process.That was from a very comprehensive paper on the subject of why the EU regulates GMOs more than the U.S. In short it has more to to with politics and risk aversion than actual good science.Please read the full paper to understand this more fully. Please follow my link.The Regulation of GMOs in Europe and the United States: A Case-Study of Contemporary European Regulatory PoliticsIn other words, most GMO bans or regulations are politically motivated and have nothing to do with science.What do most of the world’s scientific organizations have to say about it, including European.AAASThe American Association for the Advancement of Science is an international non-profit organization and serves some 261 affiliated societies and academies of science.“The science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe”.AMAThe premier body of physicians in the United States.“There is no scientific justification for special labeling of genetically modified foods.Bioengineered foods have been consumed for close to 20 years, and during that time, no overt consequences on human health have been reported and/or substantiated in the peer-reviewed literature.”WHOThe World Health Organization (WHO) is the direction and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.“No effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of GM foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved.ECThe European Commission (EC) is the executive body of the European Union“The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs are no more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.”NASThe National Academy of Sciences is a non-profit organization in the United Staes.

11.0,"Absolutely organic means of production can easily supply enough food to support not only current population but many many more people too.Hunger has very little to do with lack of supply in Today\u2019s World. Usually it is a symptom of poverty or war. There is food available but some just can\u2019t get to the food because they either can\u2019t afford it or there are people with guns in the way blocking access.Organic production solves some of these problems because generally it takes more labor to produce high quality organic produce. Not always but quite often. More labor means jobs for those poor who can\u2019t afford food. Furthermore not only do they gain jobs, the farmer always takes their personal food off the top before selling the excess as a cash crop. So these will be well fed poor rather than starving poor.But the majority of the problem is due to agriculture purposely being wasteful in the industrial models of production.\In reality organic production models properly integrated with animals and crops in symbiosis would cause an explosion of high quality food worldwide. None need be starving. But organic production would not be able to supply some of the purposely wasteful industries industrial ag currently supplies now. For example currently the U.S. produces 14 billion + U.S. liquid gallons of ethanol fuel. This is primarily made from excess corn production beyond what is possible for every man woman and child in the world to ever eat. Organic production models don\u2019t need to purposely produce extra corn so as to purposely waste it making fuels that nobody wants anyway. It is ridiculously inefficient anyway. But it was designed that way on purpose. Simply a way for industry to purposely make money off inefficiency. It would all collapse tomorrow without multiple billions and billions in government subsidies paid for by you and me propping it up.Now instead of growing corn to make ethanol fuel additives, we allowed the great tallgrass prairies to return and raised our food on that instead? Huge increases in primary productivity so large that even taking a smaller % would still easily beat the industrial production models hands down. In fact the current subsidized production models are so inefficient, making that change would still even allow ethanol production off the excess grass! Strange as it may sound, ethanol production is so inefficient and takes so much energy to produce, even a smaller amount of grass produced ethanol would have by far more net gain in energy!Grass Makes Better Ethanol than Corn DoesAnd we know full well grass makes better beef! (If you are old enough to remember beef before feedlots) Not only just more better tasting beef per acre, but more nutritional as well.(unfortunately looks like hackers took down my best reference for health benefits, but luckily I have already posted most in long form on another Quora answer. So while all these Chico University links are now broken, you can find the citations the hard way)That leaves room for a return of wildlife as well!Grassland Birds: Fostering Habitats Using Rotational GrazingSo not only can organic feed more people, it can also rescue starving wildlife from extinction!But wait! \u2026.. There\u2019s more!Not only can organic production feed people better, provide jobs for the poor, make biofuels better, feed animals better and help wildlife better; it is also possible to mitigate man made global warming (AGW) too!Farming a climate change solutionCan we reverse global warming?In conclusion there is no reason preventing change to organic production systems worldwide excepting to feed the profits of a parasitic elite class that profit off the suffering of others. The big boys don\u2019t want the change and are doing everything in their power to prevent it. Why? Because they are not clever enough to profit from economies of abundance, having made all their profits from economies of scarcity. They are just not smart enough. Sorry but it is truth. Most the so called elites are really quite stupid, but have managed to rig the system in such a way as to stay on top by economic brute force and ignorance.\u201cI am an organic farmer.

11.0,"There are strong studies which linked GMOs to harmful effects, including cancer.This famous French study was first dropped from the journal due to pressure and lobbying from Monsanto corporation and other american interests, but when its researchers sued the journal in the court and won on grounds that the research and its data was scientifically solid and viable, it was republished by the very same journal that dropped it upon pressure, by court order.Page on the-scientist.comThis study - Seralini Study - basically repeated the exact experiment Monsanto corporation used to vouch for the safety of its GMOs. The difference is that, Monsanto's test duration was merely 90 days, whereas Seralini study kept the experiment going for Two years.

Incidentally, they are also the inventors and producers of Agent Orange chemical weapon, which USA used in Vietnam. And Aspartame artificial sweetener , which was linked to cancer itself.Aspartame controversyNow, the reason why such stuff are 'controversial' is solely because these corporations spend massive funds in order to do propaganda for their benefit. Like how they declared they were going to spend advertising money to combat 'global warming propaganda', and thus made global warming a 'controversial issue' in USA - not the rest of the world, or how energy saving light bulbs have become a 'cancerous, dangerous technology' in USA with same kind of advertising spending - to the extent that there is a strong segment of americans who think that incandescent lightbulbs are 'freedom' and they are 'safe'. While they pay ~70% more for the lighting they are using with incandescent bulbs.............GMOs actually pose a far greater danger than cancer risk or other health risks to individuals:Once a modified organism gets out into the wild and succeeds in reproducing, you can never take it back. Consider it like a virus.And you can never expect what the effects of such a rogue GMO will be in the wild in the broader ecosystems - on insects, other plants, and bigger animals and eventually entire ecosystems.To understand how big ecosystem damage can be, consider the case of big snakes (pythons) which had been released into the wild by pet owners from Florida when they grew too big:Florida Python Invasion: ‘No Going Back’ As Snake Population Spirals Out Of ControlThey are a plague now, totally changing the ecosystem by their presence. What will it end up in, no one can tell.This is despite they are NOT a genetically modified creature - they are totally normal, but we cant even take them back.GMOs are much more virulent. They are modified to not be able to produce by themselves in the wild. However, they can crossbreed with other organisms of their own species, and therefore you can never tell when one of the strains that you were putting in the wild will succeed in breaking away and changing maybe entire wold with no way to turn it back.And the effects of the combinations of the modified genes with whichever non modified member of their species they mate and breed outside the lab, is not known, and due to insane number of probabilities which span variations and future generations, will never be known.There is a reason why environmental organizations set up a seed bank in Norway to protect original, unmodified versions of our fauna and flora.Svalbard Global Seed Vault",2015-10-14T02:07:16.836Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1NTYyMzg1,27.0,5562385.0,Is GMO food really harmful to human health and banned in some developed countries like US?,https://www.quora.com/Is-GMO-food-really-harmful-to-human-health-and-banned-in-some-developed-countries-like-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44.0,"I’ll keep it relatively brief.I think the idea has merit, but in practice, GMOs have become a way for big companies to make a lot of money by encouraging farmers to grow their patented products, which show optimal performance typically in a chemically-intensive growing environment. And, not coincidentally, those chemicals are also sold by the companies which sell the patented seeds. Sure, that doesn’t describe all GMOs, but it does describe many. Feel free to peruse the approved varieties listed below.GM Approval Database- ISAAA.orgPeople will argue that GMOs are the answer to meeting food production demands for a growing global population. They say that current methods without GMOs won’t satisfy that demand after a point. I don’t think this is the right way to solve that problem — its like coming up with a drug to deal with the side-effects of another drug, but ignoring the original cause.What’s really going on is a degradation of soil as a natural resource as a result of conventional agriculture. Throwing more intensive conventional agriculture at the problem to circumvent the lowered output of a degraded resource will only further degrade that resource over time. The better answer would be to seek to replenish that resource — to rebuild soil. And the better way to do that is through no-till agriculture which integrates pastured livestock management and crop rotation.Here is a relatively short video of Gabe Brown giving a TedTalk on no-till agriculture.If you have the time for a much longer talk, which includes comparison of soil composition and testing, yields, water usage, etc., you’ll find others by searching on YouTube.no-till farming gabe brownBecause of the amount of information presented, these are considerably longer.These are real farmers using systems that rely less or not at all on costly chemical inputs — including fertilizer. Their production has gone up, and by integrating several revenue streams into their farming, they are able to get a lot more from their land than if they adopted conventional repeat-monocropping with chemical additions and patented seed. And while they’re at it, they’re rebuilding soil and sequestering carbon. To me, this is a better path than tweaking crops to be able to grow after being sprayed with herbicides.I’m not against all GMOs at all. I think there is much good that can come of this tool — the GMO virus-resistant papaya comes to mind, which can be grown where Papaya Ringspot Virus is prevalent and would otherwise make raising this crop impossible. So before anyone replies to this answer with “GMOs are safe” or “you’re anti-science” please just don’t bother. That’s not what my angst against some of them (i.e. herbicide-resistant crops) is about. I just don’t think they’re all they’re hyped to be, nor are they the solution I’d prefer. We don’t need to tweak crops to produce better in degraded soil — we need to replenish the soil.ETA — I keep trying to copy the video URL to start at the beginning, but it doesn’t seem to be working.

4.0,"Europe generally imposes a higher standard for safety than does the US. Europeans subscribe to something called the precautionary principal - the principle that the introduction of a new product or process whose ultimate effects are disputed or unknown should be resisted. The notion is that the research can continue, and when the results are known to be safe the product can be added. Effectively, they haven’t said that GMO foods (of which there are many varieties with potentially very different impacts) are bad: they’ve said that we don’t know they are safe and we are unwilling to become guinea pigs while the companies figure it out.The US requires proof that something ISN’T safe - which, with ingredients that may have long term or incremental impact, can be difficult or impossible to show. Further, GMO isn’t actually regulated here by the FDA. There is no rule here that bars process changes (there is in the EU but not here), and GMO isn’t regarded as an additive, so the rules that the FDA is given (by congress) don’t apply. In the initial case where they dragged their feet and were unwilling to approve rBST , congress stepped in and passed a law making it legal.

55.0,"No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.",2014-08-04T14:38:10.138Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyMjU0MTYx,5.0,2254161.0,Are genetically modified foods harmful to human health in the long run?,https://www.quora.com/Are-genetically-modified-foods-harmful-to-human-health-in-the-long-run,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14.0,"The only proven health issues with GMOs are possible allergic reactions. But those occur with non GMO foods too. The health and environmental benefits of GMO foods are substantial: higher nutrition levels, fewer inputs(fertilizer and pesticides) higher yields, longer season, wider range of growing areas, etc. I wii cite a couple of real, not theoretical, examples.In the western US the Pink Bollworm (PBW) is a big threat to cotton. It only feeds on cotton and okra, a close relative. The adult moth lays eggs on the cotton boll (fruiting structure that holds the seed and lint fibers) When the eggs hatch the larva (worm) eats its way into the boll, heading for the seed, which holds the protein it needs to survive. The worm is vulnerable to chemical control for 2–3 days, then it is too far into the boll to kill. Once the worm reaches the seed the boll, and lint is ruined. Some growers try to time spraying by trapping and counting the moth flights, picking the peak times to spray. You can never get all of the worms or moths unless you spray every night, which is cost prohibitive and environmentally un sound. A recent GMO discovery has for the most part solved this problem. Plant breeders have found way to “inject” cotton with a bacteria, Bacillus Thuringensis, into cotton. The seed of that inoculated cotton actually has the bacteria in it, which spreads throughout the plant as it grows. The PBW hatches and feeds on any part of the plant and it ingests the BT, which causes the worm to die. As a result 6 to 10 pesticide applications are eliminated. That means the cotton growing regions use thousands of pounds less pesticides every season. Did I mention the Bacillus Thuringensis is certified Organic?Another example of GMO benefits is Golden Rice. Some islands in the West Pacific Rim have been growing rice for generations with low levels of micronutrients. Beta Carotene- the orange in carrots- is needed in the diets of children aged 6 months to 10 years for Vitamin A production, which is responsible for eye development and general health. A million children die each year due to vitamin deficiencies and 500,000 children lose their eyesight due to lack of Vitamin A. After nine years of research Golden Rice emerged. It has higher levels of Beta Carotene in the grain kernals, so much so that it has an orange-gold color. Two cups of Golden Rice a day provides all of the Beta Carotene needed to maintain good eyesight That’s why your Mom kept saying “Eat your carrots, you’ve never seen a blind rabbit have you?”Golden Rice production and distribution has has been hampered by some governments who delay its use or stop it with excessive regulation. BT cotton has been criticized as being “dangerous” or a product of “Frankenfarming.” But GMO agriculture can lessen fertilizer, pesticide, or even water use. Genetically Modified plants can provide more food that is more nutrient laden, stays fresh longer, and is easier to transport.American researcher Norman Borlaug was the father of the first Green Revolution in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. During that time the world’s population grew by 100%, but food production grew by 150%, proving the 1700s economist Malthus terribly wrong, and the 1900s ag economist Boserup thankfully right. GMOs represent the next Green Revolution.",2014-08-18T16:09:30.484Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyMzEwODY5,6.0,2310869.0,"What, if any, are the health issues from products sourced from GMO agriculture?",https://www.quora.com/What-if-any-are-the-health-issues-from-products-sourced-from-GMO-agriculture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11.0,"There are strong studies which linked GMOs to harmful effects, including cancer.This famous French study was first dropped from the journal due to pressure and lobbying from Monsanto corporation and other american interests, but when its researchers sued the journal in the court and won on grounds that the research and its data was scientifically solid and viable, it was republished by the very same journal that dropped it upon pressure, by court order.Page on the-scientist.comThis study - Seralini Study - basically repeated the exact experiment Monsanto corporation used to vouch for the safety of its GMOs. The difference is that, Monsanto's test duration was merely 90 days, whereas Seralini study kept the experiment going for Two years.
This is the Seralini team's official website:GMO SeraliniHere is where they answer all criticism:Critics answeredLong story short, the French GMO study which linked GMOs to cancer in rats is valid, solid, and not 'debunked' as so many corporate outlets in USA claim - some of which immediately proceeded to 'debunk' the study even without one week passing from its publication.This example should illustrate what kind of political games and profits hang around the concept of GMOs.You can see what kind of pressure corporations have their governments exert from below example:EU dropped plans for safer pesticides after pressure from USYou can guess that it is no different in the case of GMO studies around the world.And yes, GMOs are banned in many countries:Twenty-Six Countries Ban GMOs—Why Won’t the US?The article asks, why doesn't US ban GMOs...The reason is simple and is a two word phrase: Monsanto Corporation.This is a massive corporation which does exorbitant profits based on GMOs. Incidentally, they are also the inventors and producers of Agent Orange chemical weapon, which USA used in Vietnam. And Aspartame artificial sweetener , which was linked to cancer itself.Aspartame controversyNow, the reason why such stuff are 'controversial' is solely because these corporations spend massive funds in order to do propaganda for their benefit. Like how they declared they were going to spend advertising money to combat 'global warming propaganda', and thus made global warming a 'controversial issue' in USA - not the rest of the world, or how energy saving light bulbs have become a 'cancerous, dangerous technology' in USA with same kind of advertising spending - to the extent that there is a strong segment of americans who think that incandescent lightbulbs are 'freedom' and they are 'safe'. While they pay ~70% more for the lighting they are using with incandescent bulbs.............GMOs actually pose a far greater danger than cancer risk or other health risks to individuals:Once a modified organism gets out into the wild and succeeds in reproducing, you can never take it back. Consider it like a virus.And you can never expect what the effects of such a rogue GMO will be in the wild in the broader ecosystems - on insects, other plants, and bigger animals and eventually entire ecosystems.To understand how big ecosystem damage can be, consider the case of big snakes (pythons) which had been released into the wild by pet owners from Florida when they grew too big:Florida Python Invasion: ‘No Going Back’ As Snake Population Spirals Out Of ControlThey are a plague now, totally changing the ecosystem by their presence. What will it end up in, no one can tell.This is despite they are NOT a genetically modified creature - they are totally normal, but we cant even take them back.GMOs are much more virulent. They are modified to not be able to produce by themselves in the wild. However, they can crossbreed with other organisms of their own species, and therefore you can never tell when one of the strains that you were putting in the wild will succeed in breaking away and changing maybe entire wold with no way to turn it back.And the effects of the combinations of the modified genes with whichever non modified member of their species they mate and breed outside the lab, is not known, and due to insane number of probabilities which span variations and future generations, will never be known.There is a reason why environmental organizations set up a seed bank in Norway to protect original, unmodified versions of our fauna and flora.Svalbard Global Seed Vault",2015-10-14T02:07:16.836Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1NTYyMzg1,7.0,5562385.0,Is GMO food really harmful to human health and banned in some developed countries like US?,https://www.quora.com/Is-GMO-food-really-harmful-to-human-health-and-banned-in-some-developed-countries-like-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15.0,"Hundreds of such studies have been done, including long-term effects, by researchers across the globe and done in public institutions with public funding. In fact, there's a list: Studies with independent fundingThe conclusions are clear: no negative effects. GMO's are just as nutritious as non-GMO's (except when they are designed to be even more nutritious, like Golden Rice) and cause no health problems. Here is a literature review of these results, and another assessment of GE food safety here.Note that studies do exist saying GMO's are bad… but you asked for good ones. Studies existed saying vaccines cause autism and that cigarettes are harmless, but those studies were flawed and a few were retracted. It is important to 1) not let a single study trump the dozens of studies that contradict it, 2) not confuse opinion papers with actual science research, and 3) be sure that any study has valid controls, a large sample size, no conflict of interest (be it big-Agritech or big-Organic, both of which have millions to burn), and is otherwise scientifically sound. A study that tried to show GMO corn gives rats cancer, for example, was debunked when scientists pointed out they used cancer-prone rats in the study, who would have gotten sick even if they were fed organic food, or nothing at all.Ultimately, while political and economic opposition to GMO's may be valid, the science is clear that they are safe.

28.0,"I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control. This is not product that is being sold to help American families.The link below was deleted by the magazine after sharing. Here is the backup.China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be Buying (deleted after sharing)China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be BuyingThe Snack Food and Corn Syrup Lobbyist Shaping Guidelines for AmericansIf you’re consuming mostly genetically modified organisms into your diet, it means that you are not cooking your food from scratch. Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day.

They have done nothing to verify the scare-mongering rubbish that they publish, and often they feed off each other without looking for any new information at all.It’s important to distinguish among the various forms of GE. The safety of Roundup-ready crops can’t be compared with that of crops integrating genes from Bacillus thuringia, since the former requires the use of even heavier doses of a human-toxic herbicide (Roundup) than regular crops of the same species do, while the latter require little or no pesticide use unlike the traditional crops of the same species.Anyone who reads the actual science published in reputable, peer-reviewed journals will understand that what they call GMOs (genetically-modified organisms) are just the latest in a long line of organisms genetically modified by humans that began when agriculture started, thousands of years ago. Farmers have always used various tools to do this, and now they have tools that originate in labs to use as well. That’s all it is.Because of the fears expressed by people who can’t or won’t understand the real science of it, any newly-modified organism that has been produced by lab techniques instead of the older breeding techniques is exhaustively tested before being made available to farmers.

10.0,"Literally nothing, no GMO has ever been found to be harmful over forty years of research and with billions consuming them daily. Not only are they extremely safe beyond any reasonable doubt, but they also have the potential to save the million or more people that die from starvation and the half-million or more that permanently lose their eyesight from malnutrition every year. A GMO is simply a food derived from an organism that has had it’s DNA altered somehow to make it bigger, tastier, heat resistant, cold resistant, etc. The way DNA is altered today is by using enzymes (little chemically active proteins) to cut open DNA and insert DNA from a different organism that has a desirable gene. That DNA they inserted is foreign and therefore people think that this must mean that it’s harmful in someway. However, while the DNA is foreign, it is still just DNA and acts just as it did in the (also edible and nonharmful usually) animal that it was taken from. Any organism you consume (plant or animal) has DNA in it anyway which still isn’t harmful… you could litteraly drink the stuff. If the DNA inserted coded for something toxic to humans then it probably wouldn’t be labeled as safe to eat by the FDA.People say that GMOs “must” be harmful but that’s just it; these are just random people not scientists. No credible Scientist has ever said that GMOs are harmful. That’s not to say there weren’t/arn’t some crackpot conspiricy theorists parading around as scientists who ignore the scientific method to obtain largely falsified results that suit the imaginary point they’re trying to prove. There are a few commonly cited “studies” that suposedly prove that GMO’s cause health defect but absolutely none of them are recognized by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine who concluded that “no substantiated evidence that foods from GE crops [are] less safe than foods from non-GE crops [exists].” One notable example is a study that claimed to have found evidence that mice fed GMO’s developed tumors due to their diet. That study was complete bs for a few reasons; it had no control group (genetically similar mice fed non-GMO food to establish that the mice didn’t just commonly grow tumors anyway) which was probably because the breed of lab mouse he used is highly predisposed to growing tumors.The only logical argument against GMOs is that while known GMOs are safe, in theory, new and untested ones might not be (heavy emphasis on the “in theory”) However, any genetically modified crop released to consumers in any country has been tested and approved by the food and drug administration, any scientist who is cautious of GMO’s is really only cautious (with good reason) about the relaxation of the laws regarding the testing and certification of GMOs.

2.0,"The notion that GMOs are inherently more likely to cause health problems than traditional crops is bogus pseudoscience promoted by 'studies' funded by European agribusiness, including Carforre. (The scientists accepting funding from Auchan and Carforre unethically failed to disclose the source.)Auchan and Carrefour financed CRIIGEN studies on GMOs.The CRIIGEN studies, and others like them, deliberately present misleading conclusions. It's possible to criticize particular GMO crops. But I can also tell stories about conventionally bred crops which caused health problems. For example; A strain of traditionally bred celery was high in furanocoumarins, and the people who handled the stuff got a rash which was worse than poison ivy. There is no evidence that the process of genetic modification itself causes health issues. (Admittedly,  I'm frustrated by the fact that antibiotic resistance genes which would confer resistance to clinically used antibiotics are still used in the process of genetic modification. There's no scientific support that I'm aware of that this technique promotes antibiotic resistance, but it's stupid to take the risk when there are other ways to do genetic modification.)Modern agriculture requires the periodic introduction of new crop varieties to prevent various pathogens and parasites becoming too well adapted to particular varieties so you'd have introduction of new germ material, by necessity, even with conventional breeding. Conventional breeding techniques actually introduce far MORE uncertainty into the world's food supply.If you really wanted to make a scientifically accurate case against GMOs you shouldn't focus on the notion of genetic modification, per se. Most of the things that can be done with genetic modification can also be done with conventional breeding and there's zero evidence that genetic modification causes health issues of any kind. 
Instead, focus on the perverse economic incentives that exist in agriculture and what it would mean if those incentives were satisfied at a faster rate. For example; if it were possible to create food with a longer shelf life then the produce would sit in the store longer. If it's possible to grow food which is more resistant to pesticide, then more pesticide might be applied. Would genetic modification speed up the rate that this happens at? Ask any farmer how they choose their crops. They'll talk about disease resistance or time to harvest. Taste or nutritional value are typically not on the list of criteria when they decide what to plant. Purchasers of juicing oranges make their decisions primarily on the sugar content of the oranges (since that's a proxy for ripeness.) And those incentives are a problem, regardless of how the crop is produced.But these problems won't be solved by eliminating GM crops, only slowed down. The incentives themselves need to be changed.",2013-08-03T00:10:49.666Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxMjYwMjUz,16.0,1260253.0,What are some scientifically valid points for GMO's causing health problems?

3.0,"Genetically modified organisms are plants that have novel genetics often outside the plant kingdom, inserted into the nucleus in seeds via a gene gun. This is very different from hybridization where two or more parents from the same species are used to produce seed that grows into a plant.One can turn a open pollinated plant such as soya, as well as F1 hybrids such as dent or sweet corn into GMOs.Some GMOs are bad for health as they have the wrong sized proteins but most of the time those GMOs are screened out and never hit the food stream. GMOs are bad for soil health as they demand a monoculture and a lot of herbiocode use to get that monoculture which kills the soil and leaves it open to a lot of erosion and flooding, but I don’t think you are asking that question.

7.0,"Unless you gather wild plants and hunt wild animals (well actually hunting and fishing causes animals to evolve, like severe fishing with legal size limits makes dwarf mutants that are sexually mature but below the size limit have a survival advantage), everything you eat has been modified even inadvertently by man in some way.This is done through domestication, hybridization, natural mutation in the old days to mutation breeding (yep there are varieties of “organic”crops that were made in a laboratory) and genetic engineering.Natural does not necessarily mean healthier, and modified by man either through old or new methods does not necessarily mean less healthy. Rapeseed has erucic acid, which is poisonous. So man invented canola which is highly modified. Yes, canola is only a few decades old. Cassava produces cyanide which poisons people from time to time, and in small doses has other bad effects. But there are different varieties which contain much less to no cyanide.What about other more common vegetables? Well look at it this way. Cassava produces cyanide probably as a defence against organisms that like to eat its leaves. Pretty much every other plant including vegetables do this. Tomatoes are part of the Solanaceae family which includes the nightshade plants. So its no mystery where in the family the tomato gets its chemical warfare genes.Okay, simple logic. If you are a tomato (or whatever plant) farmer from long ago before pesticides, how do you propagate your crop? Simple, you get the plants which yield more then plant their seeds or whatever. And how do those plants yield more? Before pesticides this means the plants produce their own. Yup, those things on your dinner plate are the winners of thousands of years of evolution where pests eat the plants. Only the strong or in this case only those who produce the strongest natural pesticides surviveThese pesticides obviously work otherwise many generations of farmers would no have saved and replanted the seeds. But how healthy are they for you? Are there any safety tests that prove that they are healthy?We calculate that 99.99% (by weight) of the pesticides in the American diet are chemicals that plants produce to defend themselves. Only 52 natural pesticides have been tested in high-dose animal cancer tests, and about half (27) are rodent carcinogens; these 27 are shown to be present in many common foods.Dietary pesticides (99.99% all natural).To answer your question, no. GMO and non GMO foods have equal potential to be either good or bad for you, its the specific details that matter. But a lot of people spread the lie the natural is good for you in order for them to be able to sell more of their products.One criticism of GMO is that a lot of GMO plants are designed to be herbicide resistant and this promotes the use of that herbicide and the herbicide may be bad for you. Well the evidence that it is bad for you is suspect. But even if it were one day proven to be bad for you, thats specific to that herbicide and since you can have GMO’s without that herbicide then it is not a condemnation of GMO’s as a whole.Also, so called “organic” produce has the potential problem of natural carcinogens made by the plant itself as well as the fact that “organic” produce can use old fashioned herbicides and pestdicides that are also toxic and since they are less potent, more are used.",2018-08-21T11:11:15.668Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozMzIwMjM4Ng==,19.0,33202386.0,Does eating non-GMO food really improve your health?,https://www.quora.com/Does-eating-non-GMO-food-really-improve-your-health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0,"People say there is no difference between (GMO and non-GMO) (Corn syrup and sugar) (organic and nonorganic) in terms of health. What is your opinion?These three separate questions with different answers!GMO – I’m not aware of any documented health difference between a GMO and its non-GMO relatives, except of course where the GMO variant has been specifically engineered for better nutrition, for instance rice with elevated vitamin A. A food product doesn’t ‘know’ or care what lab procedures led to its existence or the construction of its DNA. The old shotgun method was to induce mutation with UV or toxic chemicals and screen the mutations for valuable traits. The rifle-shot approach of a GMO more efficiently makes specific changes and then submits the new organism to rigorous testing and review. Give me GMOs, thank you.Corn syrup – It’s become fashionable to bash corn syrup. The recent ad from Anheuser Busch (owned by Belgium’s InBev) during the Superbowl was fun but a silly piling-on to this fad. There’s nothing wrong with corn syrup and you’d be very hard pressed to prove that sugar from cane or beet is better than that from corn. This is especially true in the case of beer, since the sugar is mostly fermented away to alcohol and carbon dioxide, and AB uses carbohydrate from rice instead of corn. Big deal.The bashing of corn syrup probably stems from extending the bashing of HFCS, high fructose corn syrup. Studies have implicated fructose in some health issues, and it may be true that fructose is less safe than glucose. But we don’t eat glucose. We eat sucrose, and do you know how much fructose is in sucrose? Half. We have an enzyme in our stomach called invertase that converts sucrose into its component sugars of glucose and fructose within minutes. Know how much fructose is in HFCS? About half. The two standard commercial HFCS products are 42% or 55% fructose. These are hard to distinguish from invert syrup, the result of invertase action on sucrose. (A small amount of HFCS90 is also made, but it’s not anywhere nearly as common as HFCS42 and 55.) The point is, choosing sugar over corn syrup does nothing to help you avoid fructose, which in turn is only weakly implicated in health issues that are correlated with chronic and excessive consumption. Is fructose really a problem if you’re not also over-consuming sugar and calories? I’m skeptical.Organic – There is no dispute that organic products are often healthier than their non-organic competition. Studies have shown generally lower levels of pesticides and herbicides, and occasionally higher levels of healthy nutrients in organic produce. We still cannot make a blanket statement that organic products are always better, though. Organic products are not uniformly “worth it”. A reasonable approach is to spend more for organic for the products where it matters more, which is often for products you don’t peel, such as strawberries.",2019-01-24T01:54:39.795Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo0MTE4OTE0MA==,20.0,41189140.0,People say there is no difference between (GMO and non-GMO) (Corn syrup and sugar) (organic and nonorganic) in terms of health.

4.0,"Well, we have had 25 years of consumption with no validated adverse effects on human health. Let’s add in that over a hundred Nobel laureates think they aren’t a problem after looking at the hundreds of scientific studies done on them.My thought is that any adverse effects from the gmo foods currently on the market are not likely at all.What the future will bring is hard to predict. I suppose that someone might use some new technology and/or find a regulatory loophole resulting in something problematic…..but that isn’t very likely for a number of reasons.First, gmo foods are usually regulated by at least two agencies, USDA and FDA. If they also have a pesticide effect then it is 3, adding in EPA. That is a lot of regulation. It will be hard to try and slip something past the system in the U.S.Second is the way new varieties are introduced into commerce. When a new variety is developed they don’t just plant the entire crop with it and hope that no one has a problem. They try it in test plots. Panels do taste tests (organoleptic studies). Do you really think huge billion dollar businesses just toss all their eggs into one basket without first testing the product first? It is a slow and deliberate process.Third is that gmo’s remain controversial. They are under the media microscope. Everyone will know that a new gmo product will be hitting the grocery stores and/or the salad bars of America. There is intense pressure to get it right or the producers get hurt financially and the sellers (grocery stores, restaurants, etc) will get slammed in the media costing a fortune. That is the main reason why gmo potatoes never made it commercially. The biggest buyer of potatoes is McDonalds and they said they would not use them because the bad press would be too costly. Personally that is a shame because a lot of neonicotinoid pesticide applications could have been prevented.Finally, the U.S. is a litigious society. If one person get’s hurt from a food product the lawyers will line for a huge payday suing everyone in the chain of production, distribution, and sales. It could run into the billions quickly.These are some of the reasons why there are so few gmo fruits and vegetables on the market today.The only other possibility where a gmo product causing adverse effects might make it to the shelves would be some form of radical bioterrorism.",2018-12-28T13:02:19.238Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozOTY2NjY5MQ==,22.0,39666691.0,Do you think that consuming GMO foods will cause health issues?,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-consuming-GMO-foods-will-cause-health-issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8.0,Every genetic intervention is different so the safety or otherwise of one tells you nothing about any of the others. But all of those intended as food crops were tested before they were released. So far there have been no credible reports of anyone being harmed by eating any GM foods. There isn’t any known reason for that to change.There is one GM food that is expected to have an effect on human nutrition. Golden rice carries a gene making a precursor to vitamin A. It has the potential to eliminate a deficiency disease in countries that rely on rice as a staple food. Opposition to GM foods in the first world has restricted its planting. Some third-world commentators have criticised this as ‘cultural imperialism.’Bigger crops of more nutritious foods will impoverish soil unless fertilisers are used. Agricultural runoff can then becomes a problem. Modifying plants to fix atmospheric nitrogen reduces the need for added fertiliser. That could lead to reduced pollution of waterways.Glyphosate-resistant crops allow weeds to be suppressed using a specific weedkiller. In the short term it allows farmers to use glyphosate which is the least toxic of the common weedkillers. But it does encourage the growth of resistant weeds and that will become a problem.It’s a complicated problem.

3.0,"Literally nothing, No GMO has ever been found to be harmful over forty years of research and with billions consuming them daily. Not only are they extremely safe beyond any reasonable doubt, but they also have the potential to save the million or more people that die from starvation and the half-million or more that permanently lose their eyesight from malnutrition every year. A GMO is simply a food derived from an organism that has had its DNA altered somehow to make it bigger, tastier, heat resistant, cold resistant, etc. The way DNA is altered today is by using enzymes (little chemically active proteins) to cut open DNA and insert DNA from a different organism that has a desirable gene. That DNA they inserted is foreign and therefore people think that this must mean that it’s harmful in some way. However, while the DNA is foreign, it is still just DNA and acts just as it did in the (also edible and non-harmful usually) animal that it was taken from. Any organism you consume (plant or animal) has DNA in it anyway which still isn’t harmful… you could literally drink the stuff. If the DNA inserted coded for something toxic to humans, then it probably wouldn’t be labeled as safe to eat by the FDA.People say that GMOs “must” be harmful but that’s just it; these are just random people not scientists. No credible Scientist has ever said that GMOs are harmful. That’s not to say there weren’t/aren’t some crackpot conspiracy theorists parading around as scientists who ignore the scientific method to obtain largely falsified results that suit the imaginary point they’re trying to prove.

Farm moncultures began with large-scale farming of conventional crops, like dwarf wheat.

You could tailor crops to the exact conditions of your farm; farmers in Nebraska would no longer plant to same varieties as farmers in Kansas.Fear of GMOs scuttled that.I look at monocultures the same way I look at climate change.

55.0,"No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.",2014-08-04T14:38:10.138Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyMjU0MTYx,8.0,2254161.0,Are genetically modified foods harmful to human health in the long run?,https://www.quora.com/Are-genetically-modified-foods-harmful-to-human-health-in-the-long-run,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GMOs are genetically modified plants and animals. Essentially, that means that their DNA has been altered. The change could make the food unfit for human consumption, but it’s unlikely for the food to get through regulatory bodies if that’s the case. Meanwhile, the change could also make the food better. For example, Golden Rice is a genetically modified type of rice with extra vitamins, designed to combat vitamin deficiency in poor countries.The countries that have banned GMOs often have corrupt or poorly funded regulatory bodies, meaning that some “unsafe” GMOs can get past them. That doesn’t mean that GMOs are inherently unsafe, it means that a very small percentage of them are unsafe, and you need well-funded regulatory bodies to filter out the bad ones from the good ones.Summary: Most GMOs are safe, although they still need to get approved by regulatory bodies before being sold, and the countries which have banned them (usually developing countries) just don’t have enough money to fund the testing of them.",2018-09-07T02:10:51.830Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozMzk3OTgyOQ==,12.0,33979829.0,Why does America insist GMO’s are safe when several countries have banned them for being unsafe?,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-America-insist-GMO-s-are-safe-when-several-countries-have-banned-them-for-being-unsafe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.0,"There are safe to eat, that yes.It is not clear what the impact will be on the meat industry as it´s actually them who are investing heavily in this technology.The problems are on one side that they still use Foetal Bovine Serum, from unborn calves, to grow the lab meat. You are thus wasting a calf that could be reared directly for slaughter and produce quality meat.And quality is a problem, because the lab grown ”meat” is nothing like real meat, thus muscle tissue, but just a clump of cells, almost like pink goo, but even pink goo has better texture.Actually, to add texture what they use is… fake soy meat (!). You are thus also wasting what could be a perfectly normal piece of vegan filet.Even though they resolve the problem of the FSB and manage to grow the stuff in 100% plant based serum (something that seems feasible at a short term) and they manage to solve the problem of texture, creating real muscle tissue (something that will take way longer), it still means one extra manufacturing step as compared to using the plants to create fake meat directly.It is thus a kind of a Rube Goldberg-ish scheme that will not satisfy anybody as it is more complex and thus expensive than either fake plant based meat or traditional farming.I am tempted to say that the two or three start ups that are into that are just there to make what most startups do: Make a big PR stunt, cash in on some venture capitalist, try to get sold out to Google or Facebook and enjoy a golden retirement at 30.

26.0,"You can take this question in one of two ways.  If you want to answer the question \proactively label their GMO-containing foods?\Justin Ma has a great answer.  I take the question to mean \regulations that require them to label food that contains GMO-derived ingredients?\I will focus on the United States, since that is where I am most familiar with the regulatory environment. Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do. Basically, the people who just claim that mandatory labeling laws would just \For those who insist on providing information to consumers, there is a way you can do this: label your own products the way you want, and don't force others to do so.

4.0,"Yes, there is. The scientific community has been in consensus for decades. Most of the world’s scientific academies (nearly 300) have issued statements in support of GMO safety, based on literal thousands of independent studies, mostly run by scientists without any financial ties to any agribusiness company.More than 280 scientific and technical institutions support the safety of GM cropsThese statements are a fair sign that a consensus exists. Consider the question of cigarette safety, or lack thereof. Scientists had been studying it for decades, and the evidence kept showing that cigarettes cause lung cancer. Eventually, the amount of data became overwhelming and scientists reached a consensus. In 1954, a newspaper reported that a link between smoking and cancer had been found “beyond a reasonable doubt.” That same year, the American Cancer Society's National Board of Directors announced that smoking is linked to lung cancer, “without dissent.” This was followed shortly by the Public Health Cancer Association (USA), Study Group on Smoking and Health (USA), British Medical Research Council, Swedish Medical Research Council, International Union Against Cancer, and so on and so forth. At this point in time, it can be stated, the scientific community had reached a consensus. This is 10 years before the 1964 US Surgeon General’s Warning Report, however, and many doctors were still unaware that cigarettes cause cancer up until then. The scientists were in consensus, but the public, including doctors, was not aware or accepting the facts. We are in the same position regarding the safety of GMOs today: the scientists are in consensus, but the public has not accepted the facts.Note that a scientific consensus does not mean unanimous support. There are indeed some vocal anti-GMO scientists who have published anti-GMO papers, however they are a tiny, tiny percentage of the whole. The number of papers on GMO safety numbers in the thousands, most performed by independent scientists [not by corporate-funded scientists as the anti-GMO lobby claims], and most concluding that GMOs are safe. The anti-GMO research tends to be low quality and published in journals that do not practice peer review. A few have even been retracted [which, like the original “vaccines cause autism” paper, is done when a paper is severely flawed and dishonest]. This is why meta-analyses are important: they look at all the papers published, remove those of poor quality, and try to find what the overarching pattern is: the signal through the noise. Remember that an experiment can always lead to a false-positive or false-negative by chance. This is why repetition and a large sample size is important, and why, to find a consensus, you need to read systematic reviews or meta-analyses rather than single experiments.More and more meta-analyses of the evidence continue to be published, and the conclusion is always the same: no evidence of harm, ample evidence of safety, and even evidence for benefits to the environment in addition to increased yields, increased well-being for developing-world farmers, lower mycotoxins, etc. The evidence for GMO safety is overwhelming.A Meta-Analysis of the Impacts of Genetically Modified CropsImpact of genetically engineered maize on agronomic, environmental and toxicological traits: a meta-analysis of 21 years of field dataConsider evolution: the scientific consensus is that evolution is a fact, yet Creationist scientists and even biologists still exist (about 3% of scientists in the USA), and still sign letters saying that there is no “consensus” on evolution. However, these scientists are predominantly not actually studying speciation: a physicists’ views on evolution are as irrelevant a biologist’s views on string theory. Similarly, their numbers are thoroughly dwarfed by the numbers of scientists who accept the fact of evolution (97% in the USA). When a Creationist organization came up with a list of 100 scientists who reject evolution, the US National Center for Education came up with a list of over 1000 scientists named Steve who accept evolution! More than 10 times as many people, and they all share the same name! A similar list for GMO safety could be made easily.There is absolutely a consensus on the fact of evolution, the fact that vaccines do not cause autism, the fact that cigarettes cause lung cancer, the fact that GMOs are safe, etc. The existence of scientists who reject these facts does not weaken the consensuses.",2015-09-01T05:16:47.373Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1MTI3MzUy,20.0,5127352.0,Is there a consensus on GMO safety?,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-consensus-on-GMO-safety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8.0,"There is something bothering me about this question. It is the implication that GMO garden seeds are dangerous… and the fact China might sell them without labeling them GMO to endanger consumers.I have bought garden seeds in the United States, and very firmly believe that every seed has been sourced from U.S. growers…. in fact, I have never heard of or seen imported garden seeds at a local farm supply or garden center.

6.0,"There is a basic misunderstanding of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) as all bad . This first GMOs , really , were created by crossbreeding. If you like tangelos , they are a cross between tangerines and pomelos. There was no such fruit until a farmer created it. But to more directly address your question, which I think is about modern, gene-splicing genetic modification , let’s consider the tomato. Tomatoes have lycopene. Lycopene has been to to increase heart health and lower some specific cancer risks. Kids often prefer a cherry or grape tomato to a full-sized on , as they are easier to eat and can serve as quick snacks. If a scientist could synthesize a gene which would increase lycopene production in cherry and grape tomatoes so that each one contains the same amount as a full-size tomato - is that a bad thing?Or, to keep it in the realm of already existing genetic material, we can return to oranges for a moment . Oranges are very susceptible to frost. There is a species of banana that can be grown in the Midwest of the US , and is hardy down to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. If the hardiness gene from that banana could be isolated and injected into frost-susceptible oranges , resulting in a longer growing season for those oranges. does the fact that humans have interfered in nature make the result somehow evil or wrong?I don’t mean to be Pollyannaish here, but genetic modification is a tool.

6.0,"I think that GMO’s are safe, yes.I think that Glyphosate use may be out of control and quite possibly misused.For one, the companies that now manufacture it (China) are not under any particular QA or QC rubric to insure that it is not contaminated. Second, use of it very quickly selects for ‘weed’ populations that are resistant; not so much to the glyphosate itself, but resist it’s absorption, such that the Spreader-Sticker on the application (in the required slightly acid environment of the application) fail to function. The reaction by applicators would be to increase the Spreader-Sticker content, which doesn’t seem to be specifically addressed in the critical reviews of potential environmental impact of such compounds on the theoretically present soil micro-organisms.In short, the damage caused by over-use of a foliage-active compound instead has become a soil additive in practice, and the necessary over-use of acid-friendly wetting agents in the mix confound the evaluation of actual glyphosate chemical bi-product interactions. The extraordinarily cheap price of Glyphosate makes over-use of it too easy perhaps, as the labor-intensive individual targeting of weeds is ignored, and given over to the application of a ‘blanket’ (perhaps drench) spraying on everything with a spreader-sticker content for the worst weeds possible.In ornamental applications I have seen Glyphosate not work on resistant weeds, yet if the same weed species has the same dose ‘brushed on’ (with a rubber brush applicator, as you find cheaply in any paint store), then the treatment ‘takes.’ If farm applications developed an automatic system that could ‘target’ specific weeds in a similar manner (and yes, the technology is quite do-able), then the ‘drenching’ over-use could be avoided.

2.0,"According to scientific literature, the concerns about GE food consumption that emerge from scientific and social debates can be summarized in the following points:Safety of inserted transgenic DNA and the transcribed RNA
The DNA sequences that stimulate the expression of transgenes in plant cells are generally derived from either viruses or bacteria. Concerns have been expressed on the possibility that the the transgenic DNA may resist the digestion process, leading to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to bacteria in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or translocation and accumulation into the human body. However, some considerations can help to put this issue in context:Transgenic DNA is enormously diluted by the total amount of ingested DNA and is digested like any other DNA.Food processing usually results in DNA degradation, further reducing the amount of intact DNAIn most studies conducted thus far, no fragments of transgenic DNA were detected in animal-derived productsHGT of transgenic DNA to GI bacteria of humans and animals is estimated to be an extremely rare occurrence. 
But in the unlikely event that this happens, worst case scenario is that antibiotic resistance genes get transferred to GI bacteria, making them resistant to clinical therapies.And most importantly, no evidence has been obtained to date that DNA absorbed through the GI tract can be integrated into the cells of the host organism and lead to a germ line transfer.Safety of the protein(s) encoded by the trans genes
GE crop developers submit documentation of several analyses of the transgenic protein to the competent authorities during the approval phase that precede that commercialization of a GE crop. 
The experimental data collected so far on authorised GE crops can be summarized as follows:There is no scientific evidence of toxic or allergenic effects of these proteinsPre-screening of transgenic proteins via bioinformatic analyses contributes to avoid the introduction of potentially toxic, allergenic or bioactive proteins into food crops.During the digestion process the proteins generally undergo degradation that leads to the loss of activityEven though there are some examples of some ingested proteins that are absorbed in minute quantities in an essentially intact form, the consumption of transgenic proteins contained in the authorised GE crops does not result in any detectable systemic uptake, and transgenic proteins are usually rapidly degraded are not detectable in animal derived products such as milk, meat, and eggs.The application of the concept of “history of safe use” to the choice of transgenic donor organisms may increase intrinsic safety and simplify safety assessment procedures.Safety of the intended and unintended changes of crop compositionSafety of the introduced change in the GE crop is usually evaluated during the determination of compositional equivalence. However, on a case-by-case basis, additional analyses can be requested, such as that of processed foods or feeds, nutritional equivalence and 90-day rodent feeding tests with whole GE food or feed.It’s important to note that, at the moment, the route to the authorization of GE crops intended only for industrial purposes is not fully clarified by the legislation. However, the results of animal tests are routinely presented to the European safety assessment authorities, even if not explicitly required.References:This answer has been adapted from An overview of the last 10 years of genetically engineered crop safety research.I would also recommend watching this documentary of GMO food License to Farm - Official Documentary",2017-08-01T11:30:58.851Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxNzYyNzgyNA==,25.0,17627824.0,Why are the GMO foods considered safe with such a short period of studying?,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-the-GMO-foods-considered-safe-with-such-a-short-period-of-studying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.0,"GMO salmon produced by a company called Aquabounty Technologies, have been approved for sale in Canada, and may soon be approved for sale in the US. The genetic alterations in the fish do two things. They enable the fish to produce natural antifreeze (something several species of arctic fish do naturally) and they turn on a growth hormone that allows them to put on weight much faster than they would otherwise.The fish reach market weight in half the time of unmodified fish, and consume about 25% less food. The antifreeze enables the fish to be farmed in colder waters, instead of migrating south, which is what wild Atlantic salmon do.Genetically engineered fish could provide a solution, taking the pressure off wild stocks and reducing the energy and carbon emissions required to feed the world’s seafood appetite. Because AquaBounty’s salmon are sterile and raised in land-based tanks, they can’t breed with wild populations. And because they efficiently convert fish feed into edible protein, they offer a potential low-cost solution for nourishing not only affluent consumers in North America but hungry people in the developing world with little access to meat.The regulations regarding sales and labeling of genetically modified animals in the US are complicated. The fDA needs to approve their sale, because bioengineered animals are classed as drugs.Because Health Canada concluded that these salmon are “as safe and nutritious for humans and livestock as conventional salmon,” labeling was optional and left up to the discretion of the grocers who distributed the filets.In the United States, the regulatory landscape is less straightforward. When it comes to GMO foods, “[regulators] found existing laws and stretched out the scope of those laws to cover biotechnology products,” Hallerman said, “and it’s awkward.”The FDA has approved the GMO salmon as safe back in 2015, but the need to resolve labeling regulations and coordinate with the USDA, which oversees and approves GMO plants, has slowed down the process of getting the fish into US markets. Governments are anxious to get safe GMO animals into production because they see them as an alternative to overfishing endangered wild populations.The salmon being developed and farmed by Aquabounty Technologies are all female, and are supposed to be sterile, to keep them from breeding with wild populations. The eggs are produced in a facility on Prince Edward island in fresh water. The idea is that if they escape, they will be non-viable in salt water. There seems to be some doubt about that last bit. Right now, the eggs are shipped to Panama, and they are not being farmed in open waters. That may change if the issues with crossbreeding and sterility are finally resolved.The salmon eggs AquaBounty produces are all female, and their number of chromosomes has been modified to make them sterile, like seedless watermelons. However, this process is not 100 percent successful, and Hallerman and others worried about the potential for these fast-growing salmon to escape and mix with wild populations.The FDA says the salmon are safe for consumption by humans and animals. Then again, you can also find things like this.Oxitec is owned by Intrexon, which also owns AquaBounty—the maker of GM salmon. The research on the salmon did show indications of off-target effects, with higher amounts of a cancer promoting hormone (IGF-1) and larger allergenic potential. But the number of fish used in the study was so small that the changes were not statistically significant.Off target effects are mutations other than the ones intended by manipulation in the lab. The study apparently included only six fish.Genetically engineered salmon may be coming to a store near youhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/08/04/gmo-salmon-caught-in-u-s-regulatory-net-but-canadians-have-eaten-5-tons/?utm_term=.6685529887c5Research Exposes New Health Risks of Genetically Modified Mosquitoes and Salmon",2018-10-30T05:50:12.722Z,UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozNjY4NjUyNw==,26.0,36686527.0,Is GMO salmon safe to eat?,https://www.quora.com/Is-GMO-salmon-safe-to-eat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There does exist a large number of highly qualified and credentialed scientists that have worked in molecular biology and agroscience for their entire careers. Molecular biology is very well-established -- to the point that a majority of genetic engineering has been reduced to practice through the use of off-the-shelf pre-prepared kits, and been scaled up using robotics.One need not “entertain the notion that GMOs are safe” - to the extent that it is possible to prove anything safe, GMOs are as safe as any other existing technology and GMO foods, as safe as non-GMO foods. Hundreds of thousands of man-hours of study, many by people focused specifically on undermining the claim of safety, have been poured into studies and are all available for you to review at your convenience online, or at a university near you. It would be disingenuous to suggest that GMOs pose any threat to human health. Issues related to the environment are also well-studied — and there are issues, but not substantially different than unnatural act of agriculture itself.Hybridization is only one method of plant genetic modification, and has only been intentionally used for the last 100 years or so. Prior to that, most plant genetics were affected by a combination of natural and artificial selection. The 1940’s and 1950’s brought us chemical and radiation mutagenesis, which we combined with selection. It wasn’t until the 1990’s that genetic manipulation of germplasm was used to produce a plant with a novel gene (in that case, an antisense gene; one from the plant that was inserted backwards to reduce expression of the sense gene). In the subsequent 25 years, much of genetic engineering has been reduced to practice, the materials and methods have been commoditized. There’s a lab in the building next to the one where I’m standing where they have labs that teach middle-schoolers how to do DNA extractions, perform sequencing experiments, and splice genes into microorganisms. I’ve done plant DNA extractions at home with my kids just using stuff from around the house.Genetic engineering has not, however, replaced breeding and hybridization. Companies like Monsanto, for example, are foremost breeders of traditional hybrid crops. The GMO traits they provide are optional value-added products. This is not “farming done in a laboratory” - farming is still predominantly horticulture.I think it’s paranoid to believe that companies have no regard for the safety of the public. They are subject to governmental regulatory oversight, must meet various standards, have an obligation for reporting adverse events, and have broad civil liability for the safety of their products. Harm would jeopardize their business and bottom-line.It is true that people that disregard science and are fearful of GMO food will purchase food that they feel is not GMO. Objective evidence is notoriously ineffective at swaying strongly held religious belief.To answer your question, however, … GMO crops in rich economies like those of North America primarily have benefit to the producers, where the crops have higher yields and allow the use of less pesticide (which are expensive, as is their application). The environment and neighbors to farms benefit indirectly from reduced and less harmful chemical run-off. Outside of the less well-off economies, GMO traits can lower risk of crop-failure in marginal climates, address soil quality issues, and increase per-acre yield where demand is high and arable land is at a premium. In areas with poor nutrition, the addition of traits that supplement vitamins and other nutrients can dramatically improve public health. In a number of cases, some crops have been at risk of being wiped out by blights and have been brought back through introduction of genes that confer resistance.",False,McInnes,James,28.0,3985.0,https://www.quora.com/profile/James-McInnes-1,5288347.0,,,,,,,,,,

Same goes for “anti-GMO”. This is also why so many scientists object to labeling foods as GMO or GMO-free: it’s essentially a meaningless label because it carries zero information about *what* modification was made to the food. Might as well label food as “made with electricity”, or “contains no chemicals” (fact check: *everything* is made out of chemicals).For the current commercial GMO crops, there are essentially no health reasons to choose in favor or against GMO crops just because they are GMO. There are definitely some strong environmental and agro-political reasons to choose crops that have been grown in ways that reduce the use of dangerous chemicals, or crops grown by local family farms vs a giant industrial agrocomplex, or heirloom varieties vs monocultures, or to eat lower on the food chain; but those are not issues that are specific to the GMO vs non-GMO debate.

You seem to forget that before something becomes a “food,” someone has to grow it.The people who buy GMOs aren’t the people who buy foods. They are the farmers who are living hand to mouth, and for whom even a few dollars saved a month from reduced pesticide costs or a few dollars gained through better yields can mean the difference between sending your child to school or not.You, the consumer, are not the target. The farmer is. And it is very unfortunate that you, with your wealth and privilege, get to dictate what poor farmers can and cannot grow.It is the farmers who buy GMO seeds or not, and the farmers who decide whether to spend thousands of dollars a year on an “organic” certification to sell their seed to rich, fat Westerners who can afford to pay extra for food with the o-word on the label. Not all farmers can afford to get the “organic” label. But all farmers prefer to save money for higher yields, and it is now very obvious that GMOs reduce costs, improve yields, and make lives better for farmers internationally. Every year more and more farmers switch to GMOs, and the majority are small farmers in developing world nations. The organic movement is based among wealthy, upper-class people in food-secure nations like Europe where people can choose to pay more and get less. But in food-insecure nations, farmers are switching to GMO in droves, and living better lives because of it.As it is a very well established fact [and every year more evidence makes this even clearer] that GMOs are safe for human consumption and even are better for the environment than conventional crops [40% reduction in pesticides], there is no reason not to eat a GMO. So the main reason I would not eat a “non-GMO” is because it is more expensive… and often is identical to the foods without the label. Very few crops actually come in GMO. In fact, as of 2018, there are only ten plants on earth with GMO forms, and half of those are not used for human food, such as cotton and alfalfa. So just because something doesn’t have a “non-GMO” or “organic” label on it, doesn’t mean it is a GMO. For example, there is “non-GMO” sea salt being sold in stores. Salt. Sodium chloride. A non organism with no genes. All salt is non-GMO, because salt is not an O and has no G to M! Yet people will put a non-GMO label on salt, just to sell it at a higher price to people so ignorant of biology they think salt can be a GMO!

There is no other technology out there that even comes close to addressing the critical issues involved.Take so-called Soybean Frankenfood, for instance. One of the world's major mono-crops. These have recently been genetically modified to increase protein content, reduce saturated fat and increase oleic oil content.  OMG! Really scary stuff!You know, with population increasing reasonably dramatically, global warming posing issues for food production and crops and looming water shortage disasters, what are all these gormless, well-meaning, know-nothing, anti-science DFs offering as an alternative?Organic?Look, I like the whole touchy-feely idea of an Organic World, too and happen to be lucky enough to live in a part of the globe that can afford it.

Generally, if you want to avoid GMO foods, this means buying food clearly labelled as organic. From personal experience at my local supermarket, this can mean paying a premium of 25 per cent or up to 600 per cent (yes, organic can be six times as expensive). I’m not sure what the average premium for Non-GMO is, but I think it’s safe to say there will be one. No one would add a label to their product if it threatened to make them *lose* money.Honesty. “Non-GMO Project” labels often appear on products that have no GMO equivalent. For example, if you see such a label on a bunch of grapes, it’s misleading, since there are no GMO grapes. Ditto for tomatoes, by the way - there are no longer any GMO tomatoes on the market, although they still feature prominently in imagery depicting tomatoes with syringes stuck in them (a scare image that is not even close to how GMOs are made).Environment. GMOs allow farmers to grow crops more efficiently (less fuel burned, hence fewer carbon emissions). They can also use fewer and more benign crop protection products (glyphosate, glufosinate ammonium) or dramatically lessen (possibly even eliminate) the need for insecticides (Bt built-in insect resistance in corn and eggplant, for example).Food security. GMO techniques allow crop breeders to develop new varieties faster by introducing only those desirable traits that are of interest.

This is especially helpful in spots like Africa where there isn’t great soil to develop the important products to manage themselves. GM nourishments can also withstand colder climates and droughts. Their development time is additionally less in GM subsistence. Developing countries can also sell the crops produced in order to help them in financial trouble.Hereditarily altered nourishments are gainful to nature, well-being, and are more solid than typical plants.

Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.

The FDA was formed to fight dangerous food, drugs, and cosmetics, and is not beholden to agribusiness. The EPA for formed to protect the environment, and is not beholden to agribusiness. Some have legitimate complaints about how much the USDA is beholden to agribusiness, but they are not the only ones determining the marketability of a GMO product.I believe the farmers which buy GMO seedstock do so with the knowledge that it is more economical, in terms of overall crop yield and need for expensive fertilizers and pesticides, to use GMO seeds than non-GMO seeds. They also know that if their crops were unsafe, they would go out of business, so they pay attention to the health risks as well.I don’t say anyone should eat GMO foods, I say no one should avoid them.

Two answers so far, equally mistaken, from opposite sides of the GMO debate.TLDR: GMOs won’t kill you. They’re neither an unremitting good nor a definite evil. They’re a mixed bag of risks and benefits, like almost everything else in this world. They need to be closely monitored.There is no proof that GMO crops are any less nutritious than normal hybrids. All GMOs planted and marketed in the US and the EU have undergone extensive testing to ensure that they are safe for consumers.You have not been eating GMO crops all your life. Genetically modified organisms are created in labs, by using scientific techniques to isolate desirable characteristics and insert the genetic material that codes for that into plants from a different species. It is not the same as selecting the wheat with the largest heads of grain and hybridizing them to create a new variety, which is what we have been doing with plants since we were pre-agricultural foragers, selectively gathering the most desirable types of grains and other plant foods.The overwhelming majority of GMO crops are corn, cotton and soybeans, and a large percentage of those are destined for industrial uses like biodiesel, not for your table.GMOs are more extensively tested than any other agricultural product. They’re tested and monitored by three different government agencies in the US: the USDA, The FDA, and the EPA. It typically takes three years of testing to approve a new GMO for commercial use.The Bt modification allows farmers to use fewer pesticides and get more product per acre. It provides plants with natural insecticide that repels pests. That’s a good thing for farmers and consumers, by and large.That same modification can crossover to wild plants and may have an unknown effect on pollinators. There haven’t been enough field trials and research to determine the effect yet. That really should have been done before any GMOs were planted outside of a controlled environment, but at this point, it’s too late to put the genie back in the bottle. That is most definitely a bad thing for the environment, driven by the agricultural lobby’s haste to get new crops into production.The modification that makes crops resistant to Round Up and other herbicides also tends to cross fertilize with weeds, making them more resistant as well. It is also frequently sprayed on fields a few days before harvest to desiccate the crop, making it easier for machines to harvest. That means there is more herbicide sprayed on the GMO crops that do end up in the supermarket, but Round Up is used on non-GMO crops as well.Round Up and similar herbicides are suspected of causing non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The active ingredient in most of them, glyphosate, is currently the subject of numerous court cases. Internal emails have recently come to light that Monsanto knew about the issue and tried to cover it up. Monsanto has also been known to employ ghostwriters to disseminate misleading information about their products.It is important to note that the GMOs themselves do not cause cancer. It’s the herbicide they are designed to resist that’s the culprit.It isn’t always possible to tell good information from bad when it comes to GMOs. One article I found on the Forbes website is a guest post by an employee of Monsanto. Hardly an objective opinion.It isn’t immediately obvious which fruits and vegetables are GMOs, but almost all zucchini and yellow squash, and all of the papayas that show up in US markets are GM crops. They have been modified to be resistant to viruses that are otherwise very costly to deal with.It’s easy to avoid eating GMOs if you select produce that carries the USDA certified organic label. No GMOs are allowed to be used in certified organic produce or in prepared foods that carry the label.Only ten types of plants have been approved for commercial use in the US.

For decades, seed companies have used irradiation, chemical exposure, and other techniques to spawn mutations in crops. While such techniques are hit-and-miss, they still produce novel genes, and are not subject to the public opprobrium or the regulatory hurdles of recombinant organisms. For some reason, new varieties created using recombinant techniques have engendered much more public concern than \So, are GMO foods intrinsically bad for you? According to the World Health Organization, usually not (http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/). While the program is technically optional, all biotech companies in the U.S. go through a safety evaluation with the FDA before selling any GMO seeds. Such evaluations look at such factors as whether the inserted genes transfer any allergens from other plants or introduce any toxic compounds.There was a well-publicized fiasco around Starlink corn, which contained a gene for the bacterial Bt toxin, a type of insecticide. The variant of Bt in Starlink, called Cry9C, broke down more slowly in the human digestive tract than the Bt used in other GMO corn. The FDA considered this an enhanced allergen risk, and in 1998 approved the corn for commercial use only (e.g. animal feed). Unfortunately, it found its way into the human food supply anyway. 28 people claimed to experience allergic reactions to Starlink corn, but a CDC analysis of their blood found nothing to support this (http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehhe/cry9creport/pdfs/cry9creport.pdf).Nevertheless, this has led the FDA to become much more cautious about approvals. Since the Starlink incident, the FDA only approves GMO crops that meet all of the standards for human consumption.Beyond FDA requirements, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety came into effect on Sept. 11, 2003, and governs most international shipments of GMO products that have the capability to reproduce (e.g. intact seeds). Since most biotech companies want to sell crop seeds internationally, they have to meet international standards for both food safety and environmental safety.There certainly have been cases of GMO crops that have failed testing. For example, there was an attempt to create a transgenic soybean that included albumin from Brazil nuts. Soybeans are a staple food in much of Asia, and diets there are often deficient in the essential amino acid methionine as a result; this was an attempt to add more methionine to soybeans. Unfortunately, Brazil nut albumin is a potent allergen, and people allergic to it were also allergic to these transgenic soybeans. The development was abandoned, and no one was hurt as  result. (http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/386/1317.full)Regulations aside, the potential liability that would result from a biotech company releasing a toxic seed is massive. As Starlink demonstrated, it is very expensive and difficult to contain a crop variety once released to farmers. The idea that a company such as Monsanto would risk a massive set of lawsuits that could take down the company in order to rush a GMO crop to market is somewhat absurd.",False,Seidman,Jim,53.0,12191.0,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jim-Seidman,2237861.0,,,,,,,,,,

They try to only use chemical pest control as a last resort, but you as the consumer have no way of knowing whether the farmer who grew a particular organic apple was desperate or not.Second, even conventional crops can have pesticides inside of them. Systemic pesticides are plant protectants that are absorbed by the plant and circulate within it. They achieve similar results as GM crops that produce their own pesticides. The difference is that systemic pesticides may also contaminate the environment.Third, there is no safety difference whether the pesticide is within or on the surface of your produce. I’m not sure what country you are from, but here in the United States we have a system in place that ensures consumer safety from pesticides. The concentrations of pesticide residues allowed in food are literally orders of magnitude lower than they need to be according to safety testing. This includes all pesticides, whether they are in or on your food.If you are worried about your own safety, then it doesn’t make a difference. We are talking about concentrations that are often fractions of a part per million. By the time you consume enough to cause an issue, you will have literally eaten yourself to death. I assume that all developed nations have similar safety measure in place, so you really don’t have much to worry about unless your country is really behind on food quality control.If you are worried about the environment, I guess you would be better off with GMOs. The only pesticide producing GMOs I know of make Bt toxin. Bt toxin has a pretty narrow spectrum so it doesn’t hurt many non-target species. At least not at the concentrations found in nectar or pollen. There was a study that suggested that Bt crops may hurt bees or butterflies.

You could also blame the hippie movement, Christianity, or any number of things. But the truth is that GMOs are organisms that humans have changed, and people don't know what kind of things could arise from these man-made creations. Some people are in fear of what could happen if we continue to make GMOs; the big frankenfood scare of just a decade ago was mostly based off of that.

If you know people that are afraid of GMOs, try to get them to read a little more about how they are made, and what kinds of benefits that they have to try and dispel their fear. It's not that GMOs carry no risks, but all of these plants that are now commercially available have gone through FDA approval are are assured safe by the American Government.Lastly, just a side note, but you can't get away from GMOs. As of 2012, 88% of corn and 94% of soy crops in the US were genetically modified (mostly with BT or roundup ready strains). Given the prevalence of #2 corn in every facet of processed food, GMOs really are everywhere. Cows, chickens, and pigs are fed GMO corn, GMO corn is used to make corn syrups and a concoction of different carbohydrates used as preservatives, commercial additives and flavor enhancing agents that find their way into almost every single processed food product in America.

Here are reasons why some farmers do not.1) The right GMO does not exist yet. If you are a millet farmer or a cassave farmer, there currently aren't good GMOs for you. Most of the technology is in corn, soy, and cotton, and a few outliers. At other cases, the GMO is for a crop you grow, but the wrong trait. Say you are a corn farmer in Southeast Asia. GMO corn that reduces the need for manual weeding (Roundup Ready) doesn't help you because labor is cheap. What you need are traits for drought or salt tolerance specific for your region. Such GMOs may not exist yet. You would use GMOs, but the right one hasn't been invented for you yet.2) You are afraid you will lose export rights. This is a big factor in Africa, which exports most crops to Europe. Europeans are very anti-GMO, and restrict its import (though these restrictions are lifting). Many African governments worry that, if even a single GMO crop is grown in their nation, Europe will cut all agricultural exports from them. It's an exagerrated (but not entirely false) risk, yet it's enough that many African governments banned GMO planting. You would use GMOs, but European anti-GMO fears force you to use less efficient crops to keep your market. Economics are more important than any perceived health or environmental risks here.3) You are an organic farmer. That is probably a state you have on principle. You sell enough to survive, and at a high premium, which means you live in or trade with an area wealthy enough to afford organics, like Europe. You don't need GMOs to survive, so have the luxury of not using them.4) You are poor, in a war-torn region, in a region with poor infrastructure, etc. You couldn't get access to GMO crops if you wanted them. You likely couldn't get the fertilizers that were at the heart of the Green Revolution either. Again, this is a scenario in parts of Africa. You would use GMOs if your economy/government wasn't in shambles.5) Your government won't let you. This is a small scale but growing problem. The big island in Hawaii, for example, recently banned GMO crops. This was a huge problem for papaya growers, as nearly all papaya is a GMO [the Hawaiian gov ended up grandfathering papaya in, meaning it gets an exception and can still be grown]. Other regions or countries are experiencing the same thing. Its a victory for anti-GMO activists and organic farmers (who stand to make a lot of money if they are given total control of the market), but a huge loss for farmers. Another example: in the Phillipines, a test farm of Golden rice was destroyed by anti-GMO activists… who were all city kids. The actual farmers who observed the destruction were horrified (destroying a rice plant is taboo) and disappointed. You would use GMOs, but other people made it illegal.Note the absence of health or environmental concerns here. The truth is GMO s more of an economic and sociopolitical issue than anything else.",False,Shelomi,Matan,5.0,1197.0,https://www.quora.com/profile/Matan-Shelomi,2463872.0,,,,,,,,,,

Here are my main problems with GMOs.

1. In the developed world the agricultural market is a train wreck of government interference. We over-produce food, we waste a lot, we  have massive subsides, price supports and various marketing restrictions. Into this mess we add GMOs. They are in my opinion not in any way necessary for developed world consumers. 

2. But they could lower prices! Sure. But not as much as reducing the government interference would. If your primary concern is lower food prices, start with the regulations and trade restrictions.

3. But they reduce pesticide use! They reduce some pesticide use, and increase the use of others.  But the ones they increase could be better than alternatives! Sure. One worse alternative - Atrazine was banned in the EU years ago. And hopefully it will be banned in the US and Canada too eventually. Plus weeds tend to adapt to pesticides. But only if people use the GMOs and pesticides wrongly! True. But people are people. They will always screw up.

4. By GMOs are more profitable! Sure, they are good for agricultural producers. But in the developed world those are already hugely subsidized. Why would I want to help them even more? For a developed world consumer GMOs seem genuinely superfluous at best.


5. Organics use pesticides too! Sure, but I am only aware of two types of grandfathered organic pesticides. First: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotenone
Luckily in the United States and Canada, all uses of rotenone except as a piscicide are being phased out. And second copper sulphates. But copper has very low toxicity. You'd have to consume a huge amount to have any problems. Source: http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/cuso4gen.html

6. But GMOs can help to make things better! Maybe. Recent research indicates genetic engineering lags behind conventional breeding in efforts to create drought-resistant maize: http://www.nature.com/news/cross-bred-crops-get-fit-faster-1.15940  Beyond that, better is relative. The most common tomato in the US is know as bulletproof because it takes a lot of abuse without problems, thus it is easy to transport. For any for-profit company the main focus is profitability.  That profitability results in better tasting, or better in any way foods, only if that is profitable. As ""bulletproof"" tomatoes show, taste is not always on the path to the most profitable type of food.

7. Norman Borlaug!!!

Norman Borlaug is great, and here is why:

Nothing he did involved GMO, it was just traditional breeding.

It was a public project, the resulting seeds were released for free for everyone to use. 

It used pre-existing wheat varieties. He used a Japanese dwarf variety to get stems strong enough to not collapse under the weight of the extra grain.

What's different about GMO:

GMOs tend to be privately funded and owned, and seeds are licensed.

 Mono culture. Where is the next special variety going to come from, if everyone around the world grows the same variety? From where could we quickly borrow a stronger stem from, or natural resistance to a new wheat rust?

    
To me Norman Borlaug is the best possible counter-argument for GMOs. And I have no idea why so many people use him to defend GMOs?






8. But GMO could  help the developing world! Yes, they could help a little But the primary reason for hunger in the developing world is not lack of food, but lack of infrastructure. Source: http://www.wfp.org/hunger/causes Still, I am not against GMOs in places where they actual can help. Which is not in the developed world. I especially like this research: http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/genetics/turbo-tobacco-faster-photosynthesis-17217730 Even if it still missing half the way bacteria photosynthesis works, it is a great start. And a  35-60% increase of crop production could make a major difference even without improvements in transportation.

9. But Golden Rice!!!!

The ""Golden Rice is an effective source of vitamin A"" paper: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/6/1776.full.pdf  Includes the following experimental design:

>Golden Rice plants were grown hydroponically with heavy water (deuterium oxide) to generate deuterium-labeled [2H] b-carotene
in the rice grains. Golden Rice servings of 65–98 g (130–200 g cooked
rice) containing 0.99–1.53 mg b-carotene were fed to 5 healthy
adult volunteers (3 women and 2 men) **with 10 g butter**. 

I guess the butter was necessary since carotenes are hydrophobic, and there needs to be a sufficient amount of fat present in the diet for golden rice (or most other vitamin A supplements) to be able to alleviate vitamin A deficiency. 

Sadly the people in the developing world who suffer from vitamin A deficiency, lack food, especially high caloric food like fatty foods. Thus Golden Rice does not seem like it could help much without more fat in the diet. But fat itself can contain vitamin A, butter has vitamin A. Golden Rice by itself seems insufficient to cure vitamin A deficiency. A varied diet containing foods rich in beta carotene such as sweet potato, leafy green vegetables and fruits could prove just as effective.

The bottom line is that GMOs might be of some help in the developing world, but in the developed world they are at best utterly useless to consumers.

So are GM foods safe? Well there are 2 ways to look at this question. Option 1 is to look at it from a societal view, that being will it harm humans if they ingest this modified food. The answer to this point of view is no, GM foods really won’t harm you if you eat them and you probably already eat GM foods and don’t know it. Now GM foods can cause allergic reactions more often than the regular ones but the Pros far outweigh the Cons. Now Option 2 is looking at it from the eyes of a farmer. GM crops tend to have a negative impact on soil health and crop diversity. One of the articles that came up during research had this to say about GM crops, “The use of some GM crops can have negative impacts on non-target organisms and on soil and water ecosystems.

One topic being hurt by the increase in misinformation is GMO foods. While no links have been observed between negative health impacts and GMO foods, people seem dead set on their perceived dangers. That being said, the U.S Government should give a grant of 5 Million USD to Monsanto(the leading producer of GMO seeds) to combat the misinformation surrounding the topic and to fund further research. This would help farmers because of the added simplicity of growing insect-resistant crops, as well as the consumers that would enjoy the lowered price on many agricultural goods.

Important note: the vegetative health data (VHI, drought, TCI, others) provided by STAR has only been updated through week 25. This means the satellite data, which already lags, is now behind, approaching two weeks. There is no explanation why.

**USA Update**

The weather outlook in the USA has improved for most areas other than the western corn belt, which will get hot from Kansas all the way north into Canada. The western Dakotas and Nebraska areas will reach 6 to 10 degrees above normal in the second week.

VHI updates will improve for the USA when the data is updated. AiQ’s models are again approaching the corn yield trend due to a mild forecast driven by cooler temperatures across the corn belt. Monday’s forecast provides the first look during the most critical growing period.

**World Update**

The GFS and Euro show almost no moisture over the next two weeks across Eastern Europe and the Black Sea. Highs will be in the 90s, even reaching into low triple digits. This is 6 to 10 degrees or more above normal for the core-producing areas of Romania and Bulgaria.

Canada is another area to watch as Saskatchewan and Alberta will see temperatures reach 8-12 degrees above normal in the southern growing areas of the provinces. Wheat, canola, and oats will be the main crops affected.

Early Russian wheat yields are confirming AiQ’s bias that the last six weeks of weather were better than maps showed for winter crops. Private forecasters began revising estimates in early July following AiQ.

China’s weather remains problematic. Inner Mongolia remains hot and dry, but storms will arrive just to the south. Areas will receive 6 inches or more over the next 7 days, but the areas to the north will remain in a state of doubt. This area accounts for one-quarter of the corn crop.

The FAS update on Brazil's soybeans is a must-read because the agency has begun to address the divide between local agencies and USDA figures. The global soybean balance sheets in 2024/25 could see large adjustments later this year.

Climate change is one of the most critical obstacles, as conventional agricultural practices contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and weather fluctuations that can harm crop production.

Land usage is another problem, with farming methods causing deforestation and habitat loss while expanding cities makes agricultural land scarce and increases food insecurity. Water scarcity is also a significant issue, with agriculture being the biggest consumer of freshwater resources worldwide, and climate change exacerbating the problem in some areas.

# Benefits of vertical farming over traditional agriculture

Vertical farming involves growing crops on top of each other rather than in horizontal rows. By utilizing space more efficiently, vertical farming allows for the conservation of natural resources. This agricultural method is typically practised indoors where environmental conditions can be carefully controlled to optimize plant growth. Here are the key benefits of vertical farming over traditional agriculture:

1. Higher crop yields per given space

Utilizing vertical space instead of horizontal rows, allows farmers to grow more food in less space. As a result, vertical farms can produce more food per square foot of land than traditional farms. This advantage is becoming increasingly important as the expansion of industrialization and urban areas with high population density is resulting in a decrease in arable land for agricultural purposes.

2. Reduced water use and run-off

Vertical farmers require 70% - 95% less water than traditional farmers. This is achieved through the use of hydroponic systems, which are at the core of vertical farming. Water and nutrients are recirculated to the plant roots multiple times, so there’s much less waste or runoff.

3. Reduced arable land use

Vertical farming offers a promising solution to the dwindling availability of arable land caused by industrialization and urbanization. By utilizing spaces like rooftops or abandoned buildings, vertical farms require much less land than traditional farming methods. This not only alleviates the strain on available arable land but also enables the growth of crops in urban areas where land is scarce. Due to this versatility, vertical farming holds the potential to enhance food security in densely populated cities while also mitigating the environmental impact of food production.

4. Reduced transportation

Building vertical farms in urban areas or close to consumers significantly decreases the necessity for long-distance transportation and its associated costs. This approach not only lowers the carbon emissions caused by food transportation but also allows consumers to access fresher produce with ease. As a result, vertical farming is a more environmentally friendly way to produce food.

5. Reduced dependence on weather and soil quality

Crops may be cultivated year-round in vertical farms without being impacted by unpredictable weather. This is achieved by closely regulating variables such as temperature, humidity, and lighting.

Also, by cultivating crops in soilless media, these farms can decrease the demand for fertile land while simultaneously ensuring consistent production of fresh produce throughout the year.

6. Reduced risk of pests and diseases

Vertical farms offer a tightly controlled and contained atmosphere, effectively eradicating the threat of pests and diseases that frequently plague traditional agriculture.

These meticulous control measures ensure that harmful chemicals and pesticides are unnecessary in vertical farming, which yields healthier and safer crops for consumers. Moreover, the absence of these toxic substances is better for the environment and our health.

The weekend focus should have been the evolving two-week forecast, but instead, traders are trying to sort out Friday’s June Stocks and Planting Report. There is no other way to say it; this was a terrible miss by the USDA. Similar to 2020, where markets were signaling rising demand for months, but the agency stuck to its guns. China bought over 20 million tons of corn before significant balance sheet updates were made. The agency has a lot of discretion on these reports. 

Tuesday is a holiday, so futures will attempt to price the 4.6 million acre soybean reduction on Monday and then wait to see what weather forecasts bring Wednesday morning. Analysts were talking about next year’s soybean ending stocks at 400 or  500 million bushels a week ago, and now pipelines could be below minimal levels on paper. 

Corn was down 20% last week, and traders will continue exiting long corn versus short oilseeds positions in the coming days. Whether the USDA proves closer this time, these are the numbers until July WASDE's yield update. That report just got much more interesting. 

USA corn Vegetative Health Index (VHI) has improved from a week ago, but social media is ablaze with pictures of corn knocked down from hail and the mild derecho last week. It is very tough to validate just how much damage was done. 

Canadian weather will be another area to watch. Europe is generally in good shape, so an oilseed or canola story must come from North America. The forecast remains dry with models diverging on temperatures. Any significant heat will trigger short covering in the coming weeks. 

China and the USA continue on a path of escalation as China’s commitment to the Putin regime is unwavering. The Foreign Relations Law was passed and hardens Beijing’s position against any foreign interests-namely the USA, and Europe and Japan to a lesser extent-that threatens China’s sovereignty. The phrase “drinking from a firehose” refers to a human’s inability to process too much information at once.  This is exactly what is happening and undoubtedly worsening by the day.

As a result, modern farms are benefiting greatly from [digital farming technologies](https://digiworldofagriculture.blogspot.com/2022/03/New-Technologies-In-Agriculture-Applications.html) that are constantly evolving. These benefits include reduced consumption of water, nutrients, and fertilizers, reducing negative impacts on the surrounding ecosystem, reduced chemical runoff to local groundwater and rivers, improved efficiency, reduced costs, and more. Thus, the business becomes profitable, smart, and sustainable.

## GIS Technologies In Agriculture

Because fields are location-dependent, GIS technology becomes an incredibly useful tool in terms of precision agriculture. Using geo-information technologies in agriculture, farmers can display current and future changes in precipitation, temperature, yields, plant health, etc. It also allows the use of GPS-based applications along with smart technologies to optimize the application of fertilizers and pesticides; given that farmers do not need to cultivate the entire field, but only in certain areas, they can achieve savings in money, effort, and time.

Another big benefit of GIS technology used in agriculture is the use of satellites and drones to collect valuable data about vegetation, soil conditions, weather, and terrain from a bird's eye view. Such data greatly improves the accuracy of decision-making.

### Satellite Data

Yield forecasting and near-real-time satellite monitoring of fields to detect a variety of threats using satellite data have never been easier than with the introduction of innovative technologies in agriculture.

The sensors can provide images in a variety of spectra, allowing multiple spectral indices to be applied, such as the Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI). NDVI allows you to determine the composition of the vegetation, the number of withered plants, and the general condition of the plants. Next comes the Plant Chlorophyll Content Index (CCCI), which helps with nutrient input. The Normalized Differential Red Edge Index (NDRE) then determines the nitrogen content. Finally, the Soil-Adjusted Modified Vegetation Index (MSAVI) is designed to minimize the effects of background soil in the earliest stages of plant development; the list goes on.

### Drones: Technology Data From the Sky

With the help of unmanned technologies in agriculture (drones), farmers have the ability to determine crop biomass, plant height, weeds, and water saturation in certain areas of the field with high accuracy. They provide better and more accurate data with higher resolution than satellites. When they are on the ground, they provide valuable information even faster than scouts. Drones are also considered unsurpassed assistants in the fight against insects; Insect infestation is prevented by applying insecticide to dangerous areas using unmanned technology (drones) while reducing the likelihood of direct exposure leading to chemical poisoning.

Although drones are easy to use and capable of collecting large amounts of data in a short time, there are still challenges in their continued use as the technology is not cheap. Drones are almost helpless where mapping or monitoring of large areas is required, and it is better to complement this technology with satellite monitoring of already mapped areas where specific areas need to be rechecked.",[],2025-10-15 19:14:17

I'm not an expert in any way when it comes to agriculture, but I have had a keen interest in doing as much research as possible on this subject. I've been quite disturbed to find that very few groups are actually performing feasibility studies of any kind; the majority of articles (of any kind) suggesting a radical change in agricultural practices do not penetrate the complexity of agricultural systems whatsoever. They make arguments like ""Field corn could just be eaten by humans instead of being fed to cows, and if not we could use that same land for more nutritious crops"". They cite broad numbers that are convincing to the uninitiated, but they roundly have no sweet clue how to give their proposals a sanity test/reality check.

So here I am, hoping to get some information from people with real world experience in the agri-industry...

I have learned that field corn is a very robust crop which often grows on land that will not sustain many other varieties. I've also learned that field corn is easily harvested, transported, and stored/silo'd (can be stored dry/requires no refrigeration). On-top of that, field corn isn't very nutritious, and can be processed into high-glucose-fructose corn syrup, which is perhaps the opposite of nutritious...

**Given these issues (with field corn alone), how feasible would it be to convert the land currently used for field/feed corn into land suitable for fruits and typical produce vegetables (the kinds required by a meat free diet)?**

**Furthermore, what impact would such a massive change have on the cost ease of harvesting, transporting, and storing a nationally adequate diet?**

**Since field corn can be easily stored in silos, giving us a steady year-round supply of it, how would crop** ***seasonality*** **affect our ability to meet national dietary requirements after such a change?**

**Regarding livestock which is raised on rough forage (land utterly unusable for corps) in more traditional farming styles, is it actually economical? (can farmers turn a profit without subsidy?) In other words, would the loss of livestock on such farms cause them problems? (such as loss of fertilizer and source of profit).**

I have a lot more questions relating to the need for fertilizer (and the environmental impact comparisons between natural and synthetic fertilizer), and some additional questions pertaining to crop decision making (how to decide what to plant), the *nutritional* feasibility of a feed-corn/bean heavy diet, more questions relating to food distribution networks, and more questions relating to the usefulness of animal by-products, but they're perhaps too numerous to burden this post with.

I do believe that as a society we should eat less meat, and I also believe that, ethically, factory-style farming is too horrendous to be worth it. I want the world, and us, to be healthier, more efficient, and to harm fewer animals, but I don't see a clear path toward the immediate achievement of this. In a world where healthy alternatives are already sold at a premium, advocates are claiming that switching to plants-only would be cheaper and healthier overall, and that the environment can be saved in the process. It just seems too good to be true; that they're screaming fruitlessly from the rooftops instead of actually answering the technical and logistical dilemmas of how to achieve their (our) goals.

With the massive growth the industry sees every year, as at 2017 the global food and agriculture industry was valued at about 8.1 trillion in dollars, yet getting quality food is still largely a problem to be solved. The bulk of the problem is not in the shortage of food supply but in the quality of good food available for consumption.

Modern or new ways of farming which range from genetically engineered animals to using chemicals such as pesticides and other methods of improving crop and livestock yields has not helped. The problems are replete which include but not limited to health problems, hazardous to biodiversity in this time of endangered species, and of course reduces the potential yield of the soil itself.

Organic farming has shown that many of these health problems and imbalance on the ecosystem can be comfortably taken care of quite naturally if we resort to this style and method of agriculture. Sadly, percentage of organic foods in the global food industry is so small, valued at $90 billion from 1999 to 2016 which is just 1.1% of the value of the global food industry. This stunted growth in organic food supply emanates from myriads of challenges that militate against the boom of the organic food production system. Big organizations out there who are bent on raking in the billions but care less about the adverse effects of genetically engineered foods and their accompanied methods of production do almost anything to maintain the status quo.

Well of course, as many as the problems plaguing our world is, so are the possible solutions to reducing and eradicating these problems. This is actually what the Green World Farm project seeks to achieve. With their revolutionary idea of making organic food very much popular and accessible globally through its adoption of the blockchain technology to bring about value chain expansion.

How has GWF proposed to solve this problem using blockchain? Reading through their whitepaper they have a clear cut strategy of leveraging on the smart contract under the Ethereum blockchain. The need for a trustless system is well taken care of with the smart contract system. Breach of trust and contracts which affects farmers can be well taken care of using the smart contract model as farmers can start producing after entering into an agreement with buyers of their produce knowing fully well that their payment is guaranteed as it’s been managed under the Ethereum smart contracts system. Blockchain offers a means for farmers to contract with sellers to grow what is needed. Full or partial payment can go into escrow immediately to guarantee payment to the farmer without breach of contract and coercion by marketers. Getting paid for labour is a big challenge in the farming world, and Blockchain can alleviate part of that through smart contracts.

Having checked through the amazing idea and the fact that they have ready farms and the farmers from an agricultural rich nation like Nigeria with a known reputation of high quality yield of agricultural produce due to its very fertile soil and good climatic condition which favours farming, and of course the fact that the US farms will become operational in the near future causing even greater expansion for the farmers as the project progresses along its roadmap, I think the GWF project is one project to keep a close eye on and perhaps invest in their ICO which starts on May 14, 2018 12pm UTC and ends on July 14, 2018 11pm UTC

The farmers of the American midwest practice some of the most technologically sophisticated agriculture in the world. American agriculture is fully mechanized, makes heavy use agriculture inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, and reliant upon mono-cropping highly lucrative crops such as corn and soy. This is in stark contrast to Tanzania, where many farmers use the same implements they would have a thousand years ago, and where yields are a fraction of what they are in the United States. It is easy to assume that these poor peasants are a dead weight on agricultural development, and the transforming the Tanzanian economy will require replacing peasant farming with modern agriculture. Development policy under colonial rule, socialist rule, and the current capitalist government have all been based on these assumptions. Today’s podcast will be looking at the disastrous consequences of these assumptions.

The United Kingdom, the colonial power that ruled Tanzania, was suffering from major shortages and inflation in the aftermath of WWII. The government of the time, decided investing massively in large scale peanut farming in Tanzania would both help alleviate cooking oil shortages in the UK and bring agricultural development to Tanzania. Between 1948 and 1951 the United Kingdom through the the state controlled Overseas Food Corporation invested $2.9 billion in modern currency. From the beginning, the plan was a fiasco. The Port of Dar es Salaam did not have the equipment to handle the massive influx of agricultural equipment and the only railroad connecting the selected site to Dar es Salaam was washed out in floods. The OFC failed to plan for the massive influx of workers clearing and preparing the land for farming, forcing many into unsanitary tent cities. Most importantly, the farming itself proved to be far more difficult than expected. The American tractors broke down in transportation. The high clay and quartz content of the soil baked into something near concrete, wearing the plough shares down. Most famously, the OFC attempted retrofit WWII tanks into agricultural bulldozers. In the end, total peanut production was minimal. The groundnut scheme was only one of many failed British agricultural programs in Tanzania. Many tried to micromanage the lives of farmers, telling them how to farm their land and raise their livestock, while having little idea of the realities of farming in Tanzania.

Tanzania gained its independence from Great Britain in 1961, and its new socialist leadership under Julius Nyerere promised a completely new direction, guided by the ideology of Ujamaa (which translates to family-ness in Swahili) a form of African socialism. However, the new administration inherited many of the biases of the previous colonial government. The socialist government intervened far more forcefully into the lives of ordinary farmers, the most intense example of which was uprooting up to 13 million farmers from their traditional farmsteads and concentrating them in large villages. The official justification was that it was easier to provide health and education services, yet from an agricultural perspective they were a failure. An example of this failure was that of Mbarali Farms, a large rice farm created as an aid project by the Chinese government between 1971 and 1977, investing approximately $82 million in current dollars, to construct a highly mechanized rice farm. However, after transfer to Tanzanian authorities, the rice farms suffered from the same problems as the groundnut scheme. The Mbarali Farms mechanized methods struggled to manage water levels and weeding, and yields at Mbarali Farms decreased by 60% between 1980 and 1989. Nearby African peasants, using traditional benefits and not benefiting from foreign aid, had rice yields about 15% higher than those at Mbarali Farms.

However, the same attitudes towards farmers have changed slowly under the pro-market governments that took over after Nyerere stepped down from power. An example of this can be seen in the government of Tanzania’s encouragement of large scale global agro-business to grab land, to farm with modern methods. One example of these failures are Sun Biofuels acquisition of 20,000 acres of uncultivated forest in the region of Kisarawe. The local farmers made use of this land for water, lumber and other forest products. Sun Biofuels promised 4,000 jobs for locals, and promised to invest in roads, hospitals and rural infrastructure and so the farmers allowed to farm this land for only a nominal fee. The jatropha plantations suffered the same fate as the Groundnut Scheme and Mbarali farms, and the jatropha crops failed under Tanzanian conditions. A collapse of global commodity prices, and the jatropha plants lack of resilience to drought and local pests doomed the project. Moreover, only 44 jobs were created for locals, as the project relied heavily upon mechanized methods. The land did not revert to the farmers after the collapse of the jatropha crops, and was acquired by Mtanga Foods, a Tanzanian agrobusiness company to raise cattle.

Foreign investment, modern technology, and mechanization all play an important role in modernizing Tanzanian agriculture. However, these methods need to be adapted to Tanzanian conditions, and especially the needs of Tanzanian farmers if they are to succeed. Farmers need access to fertilizer, irrigation, and high yielding seeds to succeed. Moreover, they need access to quality extension services that respects the farmers understanding of the land he farms, and adapts the latest technology to the situation on the ground. In recent decades, government policy in Tanzania has been moving in this direction, and the results have been impressive. Between 2006 and 2016, maize production has increased 71%, rice production 247%, and sweet potato production 275%. The results match those in green revolution countries such as India and Indonesia. Tanzanian farmers, if given the right tools and incentives, can match farmers anywhere in the world for productivity.

**Seed Treatment Fungicides Market: Introduction**

Seed treatment can be defined as treating seeds with additionally required chemicals such as Imidaclorpid 48% FS, Metalaxyl 35 WS, and others, that are used to biologically improve the seeds quality and protect the seeds. This process is used in order to control diseases and infections caused owing to soil borne infections, false smut, fungal disease, blight and root rot, termite bunt, and loose smut, among others. Fungicide seed treatments aids in protecting seedlings from getting effected due to both seed pathogens and soil. Seed-borne pathogens are those accommodated on the seed surface, or those located in the inner part of the seed. Soil-borne pathogens contaminates the seed or seedling, which is the main cause of the growth of both non-parasitic and parasitic diseases.

The city of Manila had almost been totally destroyed in WWII. Population grew at around 3% a year, and the economy could barely keep up. Per capita incomes were a fraction of those in America, and the gap was growing even larger. Localized outbreaks of famine were common, and the average Filipino consumed 1,790 calories a day, 18% less than the caloric minimum. The hunger and poverty fueled social rebellion, and thousands of peasants were in armed revolt against the pro-American central government.

In 1798, Economist Thomas Malthus famously predicted that the exponential growth of human population would inevitably lead to mass hunger and famine. By the 1950s, it appeared those predictions were coming true. Famine and instability increasingly plagued large chunks of the developing. Rapid developments in public health allowed many countries to grow by over three percent a year, and food production could not keep pace. Rice is the most food crop in both the world and the Philippines, and both needed a miracle in rice production.

Soil Health and the Organic Cure: Agriculture Solutions Driven by Blockchain Tech

Soil Health is a very important aspect of the Agricultural Industry, the Health of the Soil determines its viability and profitability of crop production and related agricultural practice. Extensive use of chemicals like inorganic fertilisers on the soil results in soil degradation and general decline of soil health. The way forward appears to be organic agriculture powered and driven by modern technology

Technology and its attendant advancements over the years have been greatly beneficial to Agricultural Development and the drive towards global food security. The advent of modern farming techniques and implementation tools have assisted in this development, however this was not without great cost to the environment.

Current cultivation practices and intensive farming systems have largely been responsible for degrading soil health in various farmlands over the world. Studies have pointed out severally that soil degradation as a result of agricultural practice is very real and very alarming. Chemical intrusion- like the continuous application of inorganic fertilisers- on the soil, has been a particularly important factor in soil degradation. In fact this article, while generally focusing on the influence of modern intensive farming systems on soil health, specifically focuses on the effect of heavy use of chemical fertilisers on the same said soil and how this challenged is being tackled.

Not to get too technical, there are two major problems surrounding the issue of fertiliser application and soil degradation as it is obtainable today in which this article looks to address: one is the direct and adverse effects it undoubtedly has on the soil; effects like contamination, fertility degradation, erosion disposition and so on and the other is the alarming ignorance and lack of neglect surrounding the issue of chemical intrusion and soil health.

Regarding the first issue, the negative effects of inorganic fertilisers are quite numerous and well documented. Some of these are discussed below;

Soil Friability Effect

Inorganic fertilisers are mostly composed of chemicals which undergo chemical reactions and produce acidic substances in the soil when applied copiously. The presence of some of these acids cause friability in the soil. Friability occurs when these acids dissolve soil crumbs; causing the soil to lose its compactness. Soils become loose, less rich in organic matter and generally prone to erosion due to poor soil drainage. Over time, the soil is washed away by nature making it less suitable for agriculture. The soil degradation process that results from friability is quite widespread in areas where fertilisers are largely used.
Depletion of soil organic matter

Soil biology shows that up to 30 percent of soil composition consists of soil organic matter. Organic matter present in the soil are made up of living and dead matter. Living micro-organisms are very important to soil and plant health. The help create pest and disease resistance for plants and are also responsible for important processes like nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis. Extensive use of chemicals on the soil have been reported to adversely affect living organisms in the soil. Causing imbalance and soil degradation on a considerable scale.

A Solution Driven by Technology

The problem of soil degradation caused by inorganic fertiliser application can be addressed by simply changing the tools. The need for fertilisers as an indispensable resource for boosting agricultural crop outputs and enhancing yield quality has not only been long established, it has also proven to be a ‘must-use’. With this in mind, it goes to follow that farms must use fertilisers, but not necessarily inorganic ones. Therefore, the need for widespread use of organic fertilisers has never been more apparent. The problem has always been matching the demand needed to replace inorganic fertilisers. By their very nature, organic fertilisers are difficult to produce because of the fact that materials are less available and the process requires better technology. This is why companies like Organicco have invented revolutionary technology in a bid to match the demand for organic fertiliser and other similar organic enrichment technology.

The ecoHERO™ is a extraordinary machine that is able to convert organic waste like; commercial kitchen waste, household or industrial foods waste, farm waste etc into organic fertiliser which is just as effective as its inorganic counterpart and usable for general cropping systems. The machine is available for fertiliser production by the company and has a very high investment yield rate because of waste conversion and in-farm fertiliser production as opposed to inorganic fertiliser purchase. What is more important is that products like this are important in the bid to improve soil health and combat growing soil degradation.

The good news is that Organicco like many modern successful companies has seen the potential for improving their business and promoting their vision by using Blockchain Tech as a means to secure investment and assure the future of their company. The company is scheduled to hold An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) event this month with the aim of attracting investors who can provide funding, as little as £0.40 GBP per token, for the development of the organisation.

The Blockchain Advantage

What then are the benefits of the Organicco ICO https://organicco.uk? After all, organic agriculture is not an IT powered solution or at least not in sufficient manner to necessitate the use of Blockchain tech. The answer is rather quite simple, a look at their Whitepaper and Landing page gives credence to the idea of an ICO. The company intends to use the ICO as an investment sourcing avenue, where investors are essentially buying into the company and profiting from its development and activities in a rather large but relatively untapped market space.

Another justification for their foray into the cryptocurrency space is to provide solutions to the second challenge highlighted above, one of ignorance and general lack of concern as regards soil degradation and soil health. From previous discussions with one of the founders, the company intends to provide a knowledgebase aimed at sensitising the wider population about the benefits of organic Agriculture as well as the evils of chemical and high-intensive driven agricultural practices.

Finally, the company has taken to launching a global payment solution for international trading of agricultural commodity. The solution, easiPayer uses Blockchain Technology to implement a “low cost international payment platform designed to replace letter of credits and invoice factoring that is fast, safe and easy to use”.

These developments indicate that Organicco has a real strategy in place for tackling soil health and developing their organisation in such a ways as to be profitable to investors. It remains to be seen how well the company fares in the crypto space and how well embraced their initiative will be going forward.

Pros and cons of each type,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/6tkup9/what_kinds_of_organic_fertilizers_pros_and_cons/,,,,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/6tkup9/what_kinds_of_organic_fertilizers_pros_and_cons/,quyquyen87,Agriculture,2017-08-14 09:14:33,0.0,0.0,0.5," Currently, farmers are standing in the matrix matrix of organic fertilizer with hundreds, thousands of brand names, uses, components, ... different. So people need to know and understand the organic fertilizers to make intelligent choices, select quality fertilizer products, suitable for cultivating crops to achieve fruitful results. High in agricultural cultivation.

I. What is Organic Fertilizer?

     Fertilizers containing micronutrients, micronutrients, in the form of organic compounds, used in agricultural production, derived from feces, animal waste, Handles, residues, leaves, byproducts from agriculture, peat or organic matter from household waste, kitchen, seafood factories ... when fertilizing soil Organic fertilizers help improve soil fertility, increase soil fertility by providing nutrients, humus, microorganisms to soil and plants.

Classification of organic fertilizer

Organic fertilizers are classified into two main groups:

Traditional organic fertilizers such as manure, green manure, compost, etc.

Organic industrial fertilizers such as bio-organic fertilizers, organic fertilizers, microbial organic fertilizers, microbial fertilizers and mineral fertilizers.

 
1. Traditional organic fertilizers

     Livestock, by-products of agricultural production, agro-forestry-fishery processing, garbage, green manure, etc. are processed by traditional brewing techniques. Traditional organic fertilizers generally have a slower effect, longer processing time and low nutrient content.

A cage

     Manure is derived from faeces, animal urine (poultry manure, cattle, feces). Prepared by traditional composting techniques and methods.

Advantage:
     Manure consists of macro, medium and micronutrient nutrients supplied to the plant, provides humus for soil improvement, increases fertility, softens soil and stabilizes the soil structure, Development, limited erosion, drought.

Disadvantages:

Low nutrient content in large volume, high transportation cost, labor intensive.

Without thorough processing or use of fresh manure, it will carry many pathogens to plants such as fungal spores, bacteria, viruses, weed seeds, insect-feeding pupae ... or egg-laying eggs, Influence on human health.

 B.Phân xanh

     Green manure is commonly referred to as fresh plants or leaves processed by composting or buried in soil to fertilize crops and soil.
Advantage:
     Green manure has the effect of protecting, improving land, reducing erosion.
Disadvantages:
     When green manure is buried on the soil, organic decomposition (decomposition of green manure) occurs, which often results in toxic substances such as CH4, H2S, etc., which cause organic toxins. Green manure has a slow action and is only useful for lining.

 C

     These are the traditional methods of composting from straw, stems, leaves from agricultural production.
Advantage:
     Garbage manure improves porosity, stabilizes soil texture, limits soil erosion and drought tolerance.
Disadvantages:
     Garbage has low nutrient content, processing is complex and takes a long time. And can carry disease germs or weed seeds available in the source material (remnants of plants for composting).

D.Than mud

     Peat does not directly fertilize but must be processed for use in plants.
Advantage:
     Peat is good for fertilizer application, increasing soil fertility as well as organic soil.
Disadvantages:
     Low nutrient content, complex processing should be applied in large amounts both costly and costly.
 
2. Organic fertilizer processing according to industrial processes
Organic fertilizers are made from a variety of organically derived organic compounds in industrial processes up to thousands of tons, applying scientific and technological advances to produce fertilizers. Fertilizer is better quality, full of nutrients compared to raw materials and traditional organic fertilizers.

Phan-bon-huu-co
Organic fertilizers are produced by industrial processes

A.Fertilizer micro

     Fertilizer is a component of one or more useful microorganisms, including: organic microorganisms, nitrogen fixation microorganisms, parasitic microorganisms, microorganisms Resistance, microbial degradation of cellulose, ...
Advantage:
     Supplementation promotes the development of soil micro-organisms, solubilizing difficult-to-absorb plant species into plant-readily absorbed forms, synthesizing a number of nutrients for plant major crops such as N, Control pathogens that exist in the soil, improve the efficiency of the use of fertilizer.
Disadvantages:

Fertilizers do not provide or only provide a moderate amount of nutrients (from nitrogen fixation microorganisms, phosphorus-decomposing microorganisms, etc.) to crops that are insufficient to supply. Enough and balanced nutrients for plants.

There is a shelf life and each type is highly dependent on crop groups. For example, fertilizer nitrogen fertilizer is suitable only for legumes, ....

Microorganisms must have organic matter as a food source to grow the fertilizer and supplement the fertilizer to feed the livestock, thus raising the cost of organic fertilizer.

B. Bio-organic fertilizer

     Is a fertilizer product made from organic materials mixed and fermented by the presence of one or more beneficial microorganisms to increase and balance the nutrient content needed. Set for the plant. There are over 22% organic ingredients.
Advantage:

It is possible to fertilize all stages of the crop: basalting, applying, fertilizing, ...

To provide adequate and balanced mineral nutrients necessary for growing plants, healthy development, increasing productivity and quality of agricultural products.

Add a large amount of humus, Humic acid, Humin, .... It improves the chemical - biological - physical properties of the soil, limits the washout of nutrients and soil erosion, and decomposes toxins in the soil.

Supplement promotes the development of microorganisms that help to control pathogens in the soil, provide natural antibiotics to increase the natural resistance and resistance of plants to pests and diseases. Benefit from weather, limited pests.

Increases the absorption of nutrients from the soil by providing microorganisms that are difficult to absorb (difficult to digest), easy to digest, easy to digest, easy to digest. People and creatures are useful.

Disadvantages:
     Organic bio-fertilizers are usually expensive compared to other fertilizers, but the cost is not a problem, as a return on higher costs but with better quality will increase productivity and quality. The amount of agricultural products, thereby improving economic efficiency and income. In addition, it will minimize or eliminate the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, thereby reducing the cost of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to ensure human health.

C. Organic micro-fertilizer

     The product is processed by industrial process from various sources of organic material, fermented with one or more beneficial microorganisms, containing live spores. Contains organic content of more than 15%.
Advantage:
    Provide enough mineral nutrients, medium, micronutrients for plants, improve soil fertility, porosity. Provides microorganisms that disintegrate difficult-to-absorb substances into easily absorbed, antimicrobial, parasitic, ... soils that inhibit the growth of pathogens in soil, Plant resistance, no pollution of the environment, no toxic to humans and useful organisms.
Disadvantages:
     Normally the content of organic matter is less than the organic fertilizer.
D. Organic mineral fertilizers

     Organic fertilizers and mineral fertilizers, including N, P, K. Contains less than 15% organic ingredients, 8-18% total inorganic (chemical, N + P + K).
Advantage:
High levels of mineral nutrients.
Disadvantages:
Long-term fertilization is not good for soil and soil microflora.

Although they are in small quantity, they are as important as macronutrients. [Micronutrients include copper (Cu), boron (B), manganese (Mn), chlorine (Cl), iron (Fe), molybdenum (Mo), and zinc (Zn)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agro/). They have acquired a lot of attention in the agriculture in recent years. Now it is possible to give plants added micronutrients by using foliar sprays and supplements designed for better plant health. If the supply of one or more of these elements is inadequate, yields will be reduced and the quality of crop products will be affected.
For micronutrients to be essential for plants, they need to satisfy three criteria: 

* (1) the plant cannot grow and reproduce normally without the element, 

* (2) its action must be specific and unable to be replaced by any other micronutrient, and 

* (3) its action must be direct. The agriculture micronutrients market has gained worldwide importance in the recent past due to its effectiveness in terms of quality and productivity of crops.

Zinc deficiency is the most abundant micronutrient problem throughout [the world which is affecting many crops, including the staples namely, rice, corn, and wheat](https://www.reddit.com/r/agro/). Boron deficiency is the second-most widespread micronutrient problem. Copper deficiency is important in some parts of the world, such as Europe and Australia. Iron deficiency is important in some regions, especially those in with Mediterranean climate and calcareous soils. The deficiency in micronutrients content results in stunted growth, withering of buds, yellowing of leaves, etc.

I became a scientist because I wanted to make a difference. I had prepared myself for a life of numbers, statistics and working in a lab. Never did I imagine that I would be travelling to places like Colombia and Kenya, and getting to meet other researchers from around the globe who are also pretty keen to make a difference. But this is exactly what I am doing in my current role as a Newton Fund (http://www.newtonfund.ac.uk/) Postdoc at Rothamsted Research (http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/) .

The human population is growing and feeding everyone whilst limiting environmental damage is a huge challenge we face. Key to tackling the problem is understanding and managing soil. Soil is amazing and complex! It has many essential functions, including regulating water flow and water quality; storing carbon so less of it reaches the atmosphere as the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide; and supporting above and below ground biodiversity, which includes the plants we rely on for food.

I am working in collaboration with scientists at the Centre for Tropical Agriculture (https://ciat.cgiar.org/) in Cali, Colombia and Nairobi, Kenya, to understand how growing different combinations of plants effects soil function in grazed grasslands. This will help us determine the best plant varieties and farming practices to ensure farmers in the tropics grow grass to rear healthy livestock, and produce sufficient nutritious food with less damage to the environment.  Read more about my work and find out what life as a globe-trotting soil scientist is like in a recent blog entry (http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/day-life-research-scientist/day-life-dr-claire-horrocks).

My name is [Alex Lu](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/chensheng-lu/) and I’m Associate Professor of Environmental Exposure Biology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I study the decline of honeybee populations around the world. My team’s research has traced the collapse of honeybee colonies [to a group of pesticides called neonicotinoids](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/colony-collapse-disorder-pesticide/), and we’ve also published studies showing just how [widespread these pesticides are in some areas](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/pesticides-found-in-most-pollen-collected-from-foraging-bees-in-massachusetts/). [Here is a link to the full 2012 paper](http://www.bulletinofinsectology.org/pdfarticles/vol65-2012-099-106lu.pdf)


The honeybee decline is a critical issue and the future of global agriculture—and our food supply—hinges on our ability to address it. Approximately one-third of the foods we commonly consume—apples, pears, blueberries, strawberries and so on—require pollination, and honeybees happen to be the most effective pollinator for agricultural production. The European Union (EU) has already taken action. Since December 2013, the EU has banned three most widely use neonicotinoid pesticides in crops that attract bees for pollination. Ontario, Canada also passed a bill in 2015 to restrict neonicotinoids uses in agriculture. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently in the midst of a review of neonicotinoids.

As someone who started off as a drug designer in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries I have always had a keen interest in natural products. Consequently I have worked for many years in the use of plant and natural products for things like improving human health, colours, food ingredients, shelf life extension etc. Over the last decade or so I have become passionate about fully utilizing crops and plants and am leading efforts into promoting and realizing a circular economy approach to agriculture and industry. A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible and get the most use out of them, then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life. Can we take this forward in plant and crops science, and industries?

I think sustainability is key to our continued survival and lifestyles.

EDIT: These discussions are critical. Who knows what's right or wrong. Who knows what science is better than someone else's. If we use evidence-based science, maybe these discussions that we've had today can move forward and help solve the nutrition, agriculture and health problems facing humanity. I used to think 2050 was science fiction, it was so far away. Now it seems like it's just around the corner. Some of you participating in this AMA will solve the problems for 2050, whether in the lab or in the field. But it's up to conversations like this to elucidate the issues and to help resolve the solutions. What is critical is that it will be through uncommon collaborations. Without these, there is almost no future to solving problems today. How we worked in the past is not sufficient.

I am a current board member of the Canadian Hemp Trade Alliance, President Emeritus and current board of the National Hemp Industries Association and special committee member for the European Industrial Hemp Association. I have assisted with creating and reviewing hemp regulations in Canada, the European Union, South Africa, Uruguay, Australia, New Zealand, India, Vermont, Virginia, Tennessee, North Dakota, Missouri, Colorado, California, Oregon and Michigan, for example. These regulations govern the hemp industry. 

While state initiatives have legalized two main types of Cannabis, marijuana for medical or recreational uses has gotten a lot of attention lately while the effort to revive industrial hemp production in the U.S. is much less well known.  This ancient crop traveled with the colonists to North America and was a staple of agricultural production in the U.S. up to the 1930s. Since then it has been largely illegal to grow hemp in the U.S., though it was legalized in Canada in 1998.
 
Now, though, the 2014 Farm Bill allows some controlled plantings of hemp in any state that has an agriculture department willing to oversee production for research purposes. Many vegetarians and vegans know the hemp seed – called grain – is rich in essential amino acids and fatty acids.

I’m Samuel Myers, a senior research scientist in the [Department of Environmental Health](http://environment.harvard.edu/about/faculty/samuel-myers) at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and I’m here to talk about Planetary Health. As part of my Planetary Health research, I lead five multidisciplinary research teams investigating 1) the global nutritional impacts of rising concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere; 2) the health impacts of land management decisions in SE Asia associated with forest fires and particulate air pollution; 3) the nutritional impacts of reduced access to wildlife (bushmeat) in the diet in Madagascar; 4) the local (in Madagascar) and global consequences of fisheries decline for human nutrition and health; and 5) the impact of animal pollinator declines on human nutrition at a global scale.  Planetary health is a growing field focused on understanding the many ways that human transformation of all of Earth’s natural systems—the climate, oceans, land use, freshwater systems, and other ecosystems—impacts human health.

I recently authored two studies in The Lancet that showed changing environmental conditions around the globe caused by human activity could negatively impact the health of millions of people by altering the amount and quality of key crops. [One study](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__press.thelancet.com_pollinators.pdf&d=BQMFAw&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=hMRQJhgOvYw54BmzGyI5dP_MGlC6IHgqBzg_KHnsyKw&m=__BR8w1dxVt6I0JZtsV4caFuvQMwASgp06xN8wv1ON0&s=sv4tgzslCqcBWPVKksWvTNxW6zrRYFXqhbEdD66NePE&e=) found that decreasing numbers of food pollinators such as bees—falling in part due to pesticide use and destruction of habitats—could lead to declines in nutrient-rich crops that have been linked with staving off disease. [A second study](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__press.thelancet.com_CO2zinc.pdf&d=BQMFAw&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=hMRQJhgOvYw54BmzGyI5dP_MGlC6IHgqBzg_KHnsyKw&m=__BR8w1dxVt6I0JZtsV4caFuvQMwASgp06xN8wv1ON0&s=5KgLzzCoT94gHW_6pMJS1TSnX_xYjWQ3QMOAC9IliLc&e=) found that increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) could lead to lower levels of zinc in food and thus to greatly expanded zinc deficiency. You can read an [article about both of these studies here](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/human-wrought-environmental-changes-impacting-crops-and-pollinators-could-harm-health-of-millions/).

I’m Jon Entine, a science journalist and founder of the Genetic Literacy Project and Epigenetics Literacy Project (501c3 as the Science Literacy Project), which cover the intersection of human genetics and agricultural sciences with public policy. 

In recent years, I’ve written dozens of articles about honeybees, wild bees, neonicotinoids, plant pests and the critical importance of pollinator health on the GLP, Huffington Post, Forbes, Wall Street Journal and elsewhere. My reporting — examining the research and interviewing the top entomologists — has shown that claims of mass bee die offs (bee-appocalypse) due to pesticides grossly misstates the data. Managed honey bee populations are increasing or stable in North America, Europe and worldwide and wild bees are not endangered. 

Numerous factors that have led to some problems in bee health. What I believe are advocacy-based explanations for manageable health challenges, and recommended solutions--bans of effective, low impact pesticides--are simplistic and will do more harm than good.

I’ve written three books about the politics of food and farming, including ""Let Them Eat Precaution: How Politics is Undermining the Genetic Revolution in Agriculture"" and ""Crop Chemophobia: Will Precaution Kill the Green Revolution?

I’m Neil Brown, a fungal biologist and a BBSRC Future Leader Fellow at Rothamsted Research in the UK.


In my school leavers book, my friends were asked “What will Neil end up doing?” They answered “saving trees”, to which I laughed. But it appears that they knew more about me than I did, as I now devote my days to understanding plant diseases, contributing to the knowledge and innovation needed to develop new ways to protect our crops.


New approaches to control fungal diseases that threaten our food security and health, through the contamination of crops with harmful toxins, are urgently needed. To achieve this, I am asking: how does a fungal pathogen landing on a plant decide if it is a suitable host; how does it know where to infect or where to find the best source of food; and how does it know when to deploy different virulence strategies, such as the secretion of toxins or hydrolytic enzymes?


These are the questions I hope to answer in my study of fungal ‘touch and taste’ receptors, similar to those found on our tongue. I will focus on Fusarium, a fungal pathogen that cause disease on wheat, barley, rice and maize. The goal is to determine whether these fungal ‘touch and taste’ receptors are biological targets that can potentially be drugged to prevent a pathogen from causing crop diseases and toxin contamination.


It would be great to discuss my research with you. So go ahead. Ask me anything. I will be back at **11am ET (4pm BST)**. In the meantime, you are welcome to find out more about me, and my international experiences as an early career researcher, in a blog entry I recently wrote for Rothamsted Research’s ‘A day in the life of a Research Scientist’ blog series (http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/day-life-dr-neil-brown).

Spelt huller.  (if this question can be asked somewhere else please tell me. If my English its pain on your eyes feel free to teach me) 

A friend of mine is a farmer, and he is looking for a machine to remove the chaff of his spelt production.
So, here I am, looking it the power of reedit can handle this. 

**What is spelt:** Spelt (Triticum spelta) is a hexaploid species of wheat. Spelt was an important staple in parts of Europe from the Bronze Age to medieval times; it now survives as a relict crop in Central Europe and has found a new market as a health food. Spelt is sometimes considered a subspecies of the closely related species common wheat (T. aestivum), in which case its botanical name is considered to be Triticum aestivum subsp. spelta.


**What is a huller:** A rice huller or rice husker is an agricultural machine used to automate the process of removing the chaff and the outer husks of rice  grain. Throughout history, there have been numerous techniques to hull rice. In more recent times the processes are mechanized, and the machine is called a huller, or rice huller. These machines are most widely developed and used throughout Asia.

The common idea is to shake grains and have them collide and scratch each other and container-walls, thereby loosening the outer husk and then blowing the lighter husk away. Other methods pass the grains between rubber rolls or other soft material, this is often less damaging to the grains.


**Where is the problem?**
Spelt its a kind of wheat not as common as the regular wheat, and the machines to work on it are expensive.
My friend is a farmer with a long family tradition, and this tradition is fighting against his will. He would like to move his production to be more respectful with the environment but has no much money to spend on this 'change of productivity'. He will be able to spend 1000 or 2000 euros.


Can anyone help me to help him?

Thanks.

Gadaa is the indigenous system of governance used by the Oromos in Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Oromo have a very rich culture, fostered by the size of the population and large land areas with diverse climatic conditions. One highly developed self-sufficient system which has influenced every aspect of Oromo life is the Gadaa system. It is a system that organizes the Oromo society into groups or sets (about 7-11) that assume different responsibilities in the society every eight years. It has guided the religious, social, political and economic life of Oromo for many years, and also their philosophy, art, history and method of time-keeping.

The activities and life of each and every member of the society are guided by Gadaa. It is the law of the society, a system by which Oromo administer, defend their territory and rights, maintain and guard their economy and through which all their aspirations are fulfilled.

The Gadaa system has served as the basis of democratic and egalitarian political system. Under it the power to administer the affairs of the nation and the power to make laws belong to the people. Every male member of the society who is of age and of Gadaa grade has full rights to elect and to be elected. All the people have the right to air their views in any public gathering without fear.

There follows a brief description of how the Gadaa system works: there are two well-defined ways of classifying male members of the society, that is the hiriyya (members of an age-set all born within the period of one Gadaa rule of eight years) and Gadaa grade. The Gadaa grades (stages of development through which a Gadaa class passes) differ in number (7-11) and name in different parts of Oromia although the functions are the same. The following are the Gadaa grades:-

1. Dabballee (0-8 years of age)

2. Folle or Gamme Titiqaa (8-16 years of age)

3. Qondaala or Gamme Gurgudaa (16-24 years of age)

4. Kuusa (24-32 years of age)

5. Raaba Doorii (32-40 years of age)

6. Gadaa (40-48 years of age)

7. Yuba I (48-56 years of age)

8. Yuba II (56-64 years of age)

9. Yuba III (64-72 years of age)

10. Gadamojjii (72-80 years of age)

11. Jaarsa (80 and above years of age)

We will briefly describe the duties of a Gadaa class as it passes through the above grades.

The Dabballee are sons of the Gadaa class who are in power, the Luba. They are boys up to 8 years of age. Thus this is a stage of childhood. Upon reaching their eighth year, they enter the Folle grade. At this age they are allowed to go further away from their villages and to perform light work.

At 16 years old, they enter the Qondaala. They may now go long distances to hunt and perform heavy work. Three years before the Qondaala ends, those of the Gadaa class come together and nominate the future group leaders (hayyu council) who eventually will constitute its presidium and thereby the executive, judicial and ritual authorities. The final election is preceded by an often lengthy campaign of negotiations. After nomination, the candidates tour the region accompanied by their supporters to win the backing of the people before election, The individuals will be elected on the basis of wisdom, bravery, health and physical fitness.

In the Kuusa grade, the previously elected leaders are formally installed in office, although they do not yet assume full authority except in their own group. This is one of the most important events in the life of the individual and the Gadaa system over all. In the next grade, Raaba Doorii, members are allowed to marry. This and the Kuusa grade constitute a period of preparation for the assumption of full authority. At the end of this period the class members enter Luba or Gadaa, the most important class of the whole system, attain full status, and take up their position as the ruling Gadaa class. At this stage the system comes to a stop momentarily and all men move to the proceeding class vacating the last class which is the immediately occupied by a new class of youth who thus begin their ascent of the system's ladder.

The former ruling class, the Luba, now becomes Yuba. The Yubas, after passing through three separate eight-year periods, are transferred to the Gadamojjii class. Then they enter the final grade called Jaarsa and retire completely.

As described briefly above, when the Oromo man passes from one stage to the next, his duties and way of life in society change. For instance, during the grades of Qondaala, Kuusa and Raaba Doorii, the individuals learn war tactics , Oromo history, politics, ritual, law and administration over a period of 24 years. When they enter the Gadaa class or Luba at the age of about 40 years, they have already acquired all the necessary knowledge to handle the responsibility of administering the country and the celebration of rituals. It ends with partial retirement of the whole, group of elders to an advisory and judiciary capacity.

The following are the Gadaa officials and their duties according to the Tuullama Gadaa practice:

1. Abbaa Bokku - President

2. Abbaa Bokku - First Vice-President

3. Abbaa Bokku - Second Vice-President

4. Abbaa Chaffe - Chairman of the Assembly (Chaffe)

5. Abbaa Dubbi - Speaker who presents the decision of the presidium to the Assembly

6. Abbaa Seera - Memoriser of the laws and the results of the Assembly's deliberations.

7. Abbaa Alanga - Judge who executes the decision

8. Abbaa Duula - In charge of the army

9. Abbaa Sa'a - In charge of the economy

Thus, the entire presidium consists of nine members, called ""Salgan Yaa'ii Borana"" (nine of the Borana assembly). The Abbaa Bokkus are the chief officials. (Bokku is a wooden or metal scepter, a sign of authority kept by the Abbaa Bokku, the president). The Abbaa Bokkus have counselors and assistants called Hayyus who are delegated from the lower assemblies.

There are three level of assembly - inter-clan, clan and local chaffes, chaffe being the Oromo version of parliament. The chaffe assembly was held in the open air in a meadow under the odaa (sycamore) tree. The chaffe made and declared common laws and was source of the accumulated legal knowledge and customs. In the hierarchy of Gadaa chaffes, the assembly of the entire presidium of the ruling - Gadaa Class - is the highest body whose decision is final. It is the assembly at which representatives of the entire population come together, at predetermined times, to evaluate among other things, the work of those in power. If those in power have failed to accomplish what is expected of them, the assembly has the power to replace them by another group elected from among the same Gadaa class or Luba. And this was one of the methods of checking and balancing political power in the Oromo society. The second highest Gadaa assembly is the clan chaffe. It is from these assemblies that special delegates to the higher assembly are elected. The lowest Gadaa chaffe is the local chaffe. This is made up of local members of the Luba from among whom representatives to clan chaffes are elected.

The holders of these responsible posts can remain in office for eight years only, in normal times, and are then replaced by a new group of officers. The power is handed over at a special ceremony at a special place and time. The office-holders conduct government - political, economic, social, ritual and military - affairs of the entire nation for this period. During war time all capable men fight under the leadership of the group in office. During the eight year period the officials live together in a village (yaa'aa village) and when necessary travel together.

There are five Gadaas in a cycle of 40 years. If a man enters office (becomes Luba) now, his sons will become Luba 40 years from now. The five Gadaa (sometimes called Buttaa) in the cycle have names, which vary slightly from region to region. Among some Oromo communities, the sets of five Gadaa names used by the sons are different from those of the fathers. Whereas among other communities, the same set of Gadaa names are used for both fathers and sons. For instance, the Gadaa practiced in the Borana community uses the following different sets of names for the five Gadaa. (Could be likened to five parties who take power in turns).

Fathers generation Sons generation

1. Birmajii Aldada

2. Melba Horota

3. Muudana Bifoole

4. Roobale Sabaqa

5. Duuloo Kiloolee

In this manner, a given name repeats itself every 80 years. This is in fact the complete Gadaa cycle divided into two semi-cycles of 40 years each. The first 40 years is the Gadaa of the fathers and the second is the Gadaa of the sons.

Although it is not known with any degree of certainty where and when the Gadaa system started, it is known and documented that the Oromo have been practicing it for well over 500 years. However, according to oral Oromo historians, the Gadaa system has been in practice for several centuries. ""Their (Borana Oromo) noted historian, Arero Rammata, was able to recount, in 1969, an oral history covering four thousand years"", (Prouty et al, 1981). Today Gadaa experts easily recall fifty-seven Abbaa Gadaas with important events. Of course, this highly sophisticated system cannot have appeared without having been based on something earlier. Therefore, further study and analysis is required to know more about its origin and development.

Social scientists of diverse backgrounds at different times have studied the Gadaa system. Many of them have testified that it is uniquely democratic. Among those authorities, Plowden (1868), stated, ""among republican systems, Gadaa is superior."" Asmarom Legesse (1973) described the Gadaa system: ""one of the most astonishing and instructive turns the evolution of human society has taken."" Indeed, it is one of the most fascinating sociopolitical structure of Africa that even influenced the lives of other peoples. Several neighboring peoples have practiced a sort of the Gadaa. Among these are Sidama, Walayita, Konso, Darasa, Nyika, Nabdi, Maasai, etc., (Beckingham et al, 1954).

Like living organism, cultures undergo evolution in order to adapt to changing conditions. The Gadaa system has thus been undergoing evolutionary changes since its inception so as to serve better a continually developing society. However, the fundamental that occurred in the Gadaa system, starting around the end of the eighteenth century, were brought about mainly by events set in motion from outside the Oromo society. Therefore, it was not fully a normal or natural development.

In most communities suddenly and in a few cases gradually, the usefulness of the Gadaa system declined. Among the factors that had contributed to this decline were: firstly, the protracted wars that preceded the onset of colonization. The end of the eighteenth century was marked by constant wars and skirmishes, particularly in the north and north-eastern Oromia against the encroachment of the Abyssinians. Because of the insecurity imposed by such wars coupled with the distances involved to go to the Gadaa ceremonies to change the leadership, the Abbaa Duulas (fathers of war) stayed on their post for much longer period than required by the Gadaa rules. This gave these war leaders a mandatory power, because they were forced or encouraged by the society and existing circumstances, such as the continuous wars, to hang on to power. This weakened one of the outstanding features of the Gadaa system, the built-in checks and balances mechanism of political power. This in turn weakened the ideology by which the Oromo nation was successfully led for several centuries.

In addition to the protracted wars, the passing of major trade routes through the area and the subsequent expansion of trade gained the war leaders more wealth. Thus the wealth, fame and power they gradually gained enabled them to command a larger number of followers in the area they were defending. Thus they usurped the political power that belonged to the Gadaa officials and the people and finally some of them declared themselves ""mootii"" (kings).

The second important factor that contributed to this decline was the coming of new beliefs and religions. The politico-religious aggression that took place in the expansion of Islam and Christianity has affected the culture of the Oromo people very much. The invasion of Oromo land by Muslims in the east and south and by Christians in the north have left their mark on the Oromo culture.

Thirdly, the changes in the mode of living of several Oromo communities was probably one of the important factors that led to the decline of Gadaa. As the Oromo society developed, there was a gradual change in the social, economic and political life of the people. For instance, in many parts of Oromia, a settled agrarian mode of life developed fast and the people practiced both mixed agriculture - raised crops and animals - and nomadic pastoralism. The latter was the dominant mode of life before this time, although Oromo have practiced cultivation for a long time and have made significant contribution to agriculture by domesticating plants and rearing rare varieties of crop plants. The introduction and expansion of trade had significant contribution also. These and other related factors led to the emergence of a new social system, which created a significant pressure on the Gadaa system and brought about a modification or change in the Gadaa practices.

Finally, the onset of colonization had tremendously reduced the political and usefulness of Gadaa system as the administrative affairs and management of the national economy were taken over by the colonizers except in remote regions. Atseme noted, ""Menilek outlawed the major chaffe meetings in the Oromo areas he conquered."" Bartels (1983) also noted, ""Gadaa ... was gradually deprived by Amharas of most of its political and judicial powers and reduced to merely ritual institution."" Even the social aspects, that is the ritual and ceremonial aspects, have not been left to the people. The observance of Gadaa ceremonies has been prohibited by proclamation.

The Oromo people also have a rich folklore, oral tradition, music and art. For example, it is believed that the Oromo are responsible for the invention and use of phallic stones (Wainwright, 1949 and Greenfield, 1965). Decorations of stone bowls from Zimbabwe include pictures of cattle with long ""lyre-shaped"" horns such as raised by Oromo. According to these scholars, this and the phallic stones found in Zimbabwe are traced directly to Oromo and linked to their early settlements there and to the Zimbabwe civilization. Wainwright (1949) argued that these were founded by the Oromo. He wrote: ""Waqlimi and his people came from Galla land and its neighborhood, and were already installed in southern Rhodesia before A.D. 900."" (Waqlimi is an Oromo name). This date coincides with the date of the erection of some of the famous buildings there which Wainwright says were built by ""Galla."" This appears to be part of the spread of Cushitic civilization.

Although much of this culture and these traditions have survived harsh suppression, much has been forgotten and lost, artifacts have been destroyed and Oromo are discouraged from developing their culture and art.",[],2025-10-15 19:14:26
,,,1mw7zo8,,,Our season of autumn 🇿🇦,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mw7zo8,,,,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1mw7zo8/our_season_of_autumn/,Disastrous_Macaron34,Africa,2025-08-21 13:13:34,364.0,20.0,1.0,"South Africa experiences four distinct seasons which are in the order of summer, autumn, spring and winter - following a conventional pattern in the southern hemisphere. The season of autumn typically spans from the months of March to May, and the weather transitions from warm summer days to cooler evenings with fresh mornings. 

As the scorching summer days mellow into crisp mornings and golden afternoons, South Africa welcomes one of its most precious natures — the russet, amber, and copper essence of autumn. The blend of dusky sunsets, a subtle scent of pine with woodsmoke, and a gentle mist weaving through the foliage of maple leaves creates a uniquely rustic wonder. The beauty would tenderly seep into the scenic landscape of the Midlands with a rustling carpet of fallen leaves from a canopy of oak trees and enhanced by a delicate fragrance of the damp earth. In a remarkable sight, the atmosphere of Johannesburg is surrounded with a palette of auburn, crimson, brown and orange in the retreat of a botanical garden alongside the fiery highveld of the Emmarentia suburb. The display is further neatly tucked within green wheat lines and a golden column of poplar blooms that stand at the foot of towering Maluti mountains in the stunning escape of Clarens. The pleasure of immersing yourself in the path of russet-toned dry grasses and flame-coloured woodlands would lead into a long trail of grapevines with rows that stretch a special wine tasting sanctuary across the glowing horizons of Stellenbosch and Franschhoek. The mounting of monumental bronze mask sculpture*s* by Anton Smit filter through lush greenery throughout many parts of the country and furnished with varying artistic emotions.

One of the interesting facts is that the abundance of flora represents a significant period of harvesting in which many crops have reached maturity and prepared for gathering. The indigenous delight of *rooibos* tea (attached in the last photo) is no exception to nature as autumn would mark the harvest season in a quaint town tucked away at the foot of the majestic Cederberg mountains and the only place in the world where *rooibos* grows. Rooibos tea, also known as ""red bush tea"", is a caffeine-free herbal infusion made from the leaves of the *aspalathus linearis* shrub that is native to South Africa. Unlike traditional black or green tea, the household comfort of *rooibos* is a herbal tea or tisane with a naturally slightly earthy flavour and a reddish-brown colour. It is set apart for being low in tannins and rich in antioxidants - offering potential health benefits like improved heart health and blood sugar regulation. Cederberg has much to offer guests by way of the ‘Rooibos Route’ where people can learn how *rooibos* moves from farm to cup while exploring the unique sights and sounds of the beautiful region. A few hours of distance from Cape Town, the area offers an adventure of unwinding with hiking or even backpacking trips and sightseeing of ancient landmarks. 

However, much like trees shedding their leaves, autumn is also a time for symbolic reflection and letting go of what is no longer needed. The wilderness evokes a novel sense of clarity where truly our moods change like the weather due to a warm introspection of embracing new beginnings and cleansing old habits. The season of autumn would regularly present a note that is quieter than summer, a texture that is softer than spring, and a hue that is richer than winter.

Nights and weekends I run beef cattle and also grow wheat , beans , or hay. 

I tend to like the farming because it can be so quantitative, though it is more time consuming. Soil tests , tissue tests, rain measurements, Fertilizer application rate. Etc. I can sort of calculate what I expect to make and if I run short or long due to lack of nutrients or something, I can identify that as a cause, account for its risk, develop improvement plan etc.

The cattle I have a harder time, although it is easier for me to do as a “night job”. I can try to get better quality hay, spray my pastures, rotate pastures, etc. but I seem to have a hard time measuring the results of these activities. I can obviously look at the pasture and see that the spraying helped, but like for cattle I don’t have a reliable way to “measure” the impact on their health or weight gain or meat quality (I just sell calves and don’t hold stickers). Sometimes I look at a cow that is a bag of bones that I feel like needs to go to slaughter and she produces the best calf I have, and vice versa, I can pamper my cows and they create little runts. Maybe it’s something with genetics I am missing? 

I don’t know what I am asking for but maybe just brainstorm ideas to help me think about the cattle operation. In my line of work we typically say you can’t improve something if you can’t measure it. And I really don’t know how to best measure the health and performance of my cattle. Even if I just take the weight of the entire calf crop, there is so much variation from just year to year on their size due to birth timing, death loss, etc. I don’t know where to focus my efforts in order to improve. Any ideas? I thought about tracking the individual weight of each calf paired to each cow over years to see which are best producing, but I’ve never know anyone to weigh individual calves.

This period has witnessed a profound transformation in various domains of agricultural science and practice, driven by advancements in genomics, precision agriculture, agroecology, biotechnology, and digital innovation. These developments have collectively propelled agriculture towards enhanced productivity, resource efficiency, environmental stewardship, and global food security.

Genomic advancements have engendered a paradigm shift in crop breeding and improvement. High-throughput sequencing technologies, coupled with bioinformatics tools, have expedited the identification and manipulation of key genetic traits governing yield, disease resistance, and stress tolerance. The advent of genome editing techniques, particularly CRISPR-Cas9, has facilitated precise and targeted genetic modifications, enabling the creation of novel crop varieties with enhanced traits, while mitigating the controversy associated with transgenic approaches.

Precision agriculture has emerged as a pivotal strategy for optimizing resource allocation and crop management. Integration of remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has enabled real-time monitoring of field conditions, pest outbreaks, and nutrient levels. Data-driven decision support systems have empowered farmers to tailor interventions with unprecedented accuracy, minimizing input wastage, reducing environmental impact, and augmenting yield.

Agroecology has gained traction as a holistic and sustainable approach to farming. Fostering synergistic interactions between ecological processes and agricultural systems, agroecology promotes biodiversity, soil health, and ecosystem resilience. Incorporation of cover crops, crop rotation, and intercropping practices has enriched soil organic matter, curtailed erosion, and curbed reliance on chemical inputs. This systems-oriented approach prioritizes resilience and adaptability in the face of climate variability and changing pest dynamics.

Biotechnology has experienced notable progress, characterized by novel biopesticides, biofertilizers, and biofortified crops. Harnessing the potential of beneficial microorganisms and naturally occurring compounds, these bioproducts offer sustainable alternatives to conventional agrochemicals, curtailing environmental contamination and reducing ecological imbalances. Additionally, biofortification initiatives have yielded crops with enhanced nutritional profiles, addressing malnutrition and enhancing food security, particularly in vulnerable populations.

Digital innovation has revolutionized agricultural management through platforms like farm management software, predictive analytics, and blockchain technology. These tools facilitate data integration, supply chain traceability, and market access, enhancing transparency and accountability. Blockchain, in particular, has the potential to curb fraud and ensure fair compensation, particularly in complex global value chains.

These developments have collectively driven the trajectory of agriculture towards increased productivity, reduced environmental impact, and improved global food security, underscoring the significance of interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in shaping the state of the art in agriculture.","['agroecology', 'food security']",2025-10-15 19:14:29

I joined a gym solely for the purpose of gaining muscle. This is a privately owned gym which does all forms of training. On the first day, the owner and operator who is also a trainer, talked to me. **BEFORE** he asked me what I eat, have any allergies or what my eating regimen was, he gave me a run down of things to **completely** get rid of in my diet. I thought it was pretty strange, because, other than sugar, I have never heard any of the other claims. Then he emailed me that information so I can reference it. I talked to my family doctor - who knows my health very well - and she said his nutrition guide sounded like alarmist bullshit. 

He says in order to gain muscle, you have to get rid of Soy, Dairy, Sugar, Gluten and Corn. 

Why? Because it makes your muscles inflamed. And inflamed muscles slow your gains progress. That was the jist of it. 

[Here's the graphics that he sent me](https://imgur.com/a/8khKgbT). It tells you why those ingredients make your muscles inflamed. 

For your information, I have zero dietary allergies. 

Thoughts? 

Thank you for Reading

EDIT: Wow, this blew up really high! I didn't expect the turnout. I really appreciate everyone's insights, whether it was pro or against this guide. Thank you very much for commenting and replying. I have made up my mind though - I should continue going my own way without listening to this advice. I don't have any known dietary allergies or diseases and none of the mentioned food categories make me feel sick in any way (except sugar. Sugar sucks). I initially thought it was not useful to add them, but there are more stuff to those infographics that I will link , which also adds sugar. And for your information, like many suspected, NONE of them had any citations or resources linked. [More of the infographic](https://imgur.com/a/PgKeTqZ)",[],2025-10-15 19:14:32

What disability-friendly work is out there?


I'm stressing out over the effect my health will have on my career. I'm a chronic overachiever, performing at the top of my course and about to finish my Honour's year with a Sydney Accord qualification in Eng Tech and unweighted GPA ~8.2. My health has been failing pretty quick over this time. I'm 23 with degenerating joints +arthritis, a pending foot reconstruction and losing strength/feeling in my arms and legs. My specialists are trying to figure it out but it's looking likely that my limbs will continue to get worse. There are no cures, just surgeries and meds for the symptoms. Walking and sitting are painful and I have to carefully manage my activity levels. 

As is tradition for a soon-to-be graduate, I'm stressed about career pathways, with an unhealthy sprinking of health-related fear. I've reached out to career and disability services in the past but they all know very little about this industry. The head of school at my uni has constantly questioned my suitability for this work when I ask for accommodations. I've hidden what I can about my health at internships for the most part - my disabilities are currently only visible if you have a good understanding of the related genetic deformities. I will gradually need my mobility aids more consistently. 

The thing is, I love food tech and I'm quite good at it. Formulation is a breeze but I'd really love to work in novel ingredient/crop development. There are some soon-to-be lucrative opportunities in my country and I have formed the connections and skills to contribute meaningful work. I just don't know how long I can keep doing physical work and what else is out there for me. 

I'm probably going to go for a PhD scholarship to compensate for my lack of physical abilities but I don't know if that will just leave me in the same position career-wise but further along the disability train. I would assume that working in industry would be ruled out, given that mobility aids are difficult to sterilise for controlled areas? Wouldn't labs also be discounted for similar reasons? What else could I do and how accommodating are employers?",[],2025-10-15 19:14:32

Hi I’m an average guy who woke up an activist on November 9th and found this march:

 Tell EVERYBODY. Game on, April 29, 2017.

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/). 

Lets tell our representatives we want to **stay in the Paris Agreement!** If they don't, they'll see we're organized and will vote them out!

10 million strong, seriously. Aim high. ACT LIKE CHAMPIONS! LET'S DO THIS! And then at least feel like we've tried and done something historic, ya know? 
________

**Edit:**

To address concerns in the comments: **pledge to lower your CO2 spent to get to the march.** This sends a good signal, such as: train = if you can take a train. car = carpool. bus = rally bus. airplane = carbon offset (plant 25 trees per person). **Other ideas?** Especially for those who'd have to fly?

Let’s take an extreme scenario where a many people fly all the way across the country. That would cost at most in hundreds of thousands of metric tons of CO2 emissions. [carbon calculator](http://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3) 

Staying in the Paris Agreement **reduces carbon emissions by BILLIONS of metric tons and puts us on a sustainable course for good.**

The top grey dotted line in [this info graphic](http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/US-emissions-chart.jpg) is if the Paris Agreement with American participation doesn’t happen. Game over.

_________

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/) are the same folks that organized the biggest climate march to date in 2014 with hundreds of thousands. Now they’re at it again, on April 29th 2017 right before Trump's 100 days.

Are there other groups that combine environmental organizations that you know of? If so, who? Get them to join this march! 

Are there other marches scheduled that others don't know of yet? How can we combine them into one massive showing?

I think his election is scaring many of us (myself being an example) into activism mode, rather than assuming our gov is taking care of the problem (like the Paris global initiative Obama put together that Trump threatens to dismantle).

___________________
INVITE EVERYONE WHO ALREADY CARES

Peoplesclimate.org is a combo of dozens of organizations, including 350.org, as seen at bottom of page. Let's help them add even more to the list. 

**Invite Bernie** and his millions on board, all democrats and more Environmental Organizations.

Invite DiCaprio who made the powerful documentary Before the Flood, and has millions of twitter followers. 

And other passionate media folks and celebrities who can reach the masses. If you happen to know any, invite them!

And the Clintons, and Gore. If this is really about the preservation of our planet, it's wake up time.

Reach out to younger people in their 20s and even High School, who will inherit this planet. 

Reach to all environmental organizations and get them to join this march, like The Sierra Club and … ?

How about religious organizations? Even the POPE spoke out recently!!! This involves ALL OF US. This is something we can all agree and come together on!

__________
REACHING OUT TO MODERATE CONSERVATIVES

I've actually seen on reddit that moderate conservatives, many who voted Trump, still believe in climate change. I think we should make it a CENTRIST issue. Take out the political charge, and base it in stewards of our earth and country. Reach across the divide, why not? Have some real conversations based in fact. Know the economic concerns of those who push back against regulation and acknowledge them, and support them in adapting.

Recent reddit comments brought up the fact that if sea level rise doesn't scare em into action, which may not matter as much to those inland as it does on the coast, then reframe it to the impact of stronger storms and tornados, and droughts on crop production. And overall the impact on our economy if the coastal cities and towns are under water.

We need republican support in congress to move the needle. and if not, then they need to be afraid of getting reelected.

This fella is trying, for example: [Jay Faison's Quest to Save the Planet (And the GOP)](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-01/jay-faison-s-expensive-maddening-quest-to-save-the-planet-and-the-gop)

______________
MASSIVE MOVEMENT BRINGS EDUCATION AND ACTION

10 million people marching. I'm not even kidding. 20 million Muslims just marched in Iraq against ISIS. 2 million marched in South Korea against their president. If they all can organize in face of a dire threat, so can we.

In addition to marching, just organizing into a mass movement can spread actionable ideas. Educating people on the low hanging fruit, the easier first steps towards reducing emissions in our day to day choices. 

If millions organize and speak with our votes and dollars ... support green initiatives and companies, then we fight through governmental and capitalist methods. 

The carbon tax for example is the biggest government move. We need to educate ourselves on a deeper level on the real issue(s), like the pros/cons of the carbon tax. I understand it could hurt business profit, which is the reason for so much push back. And that we're taking on more of the burden as part of the Paris Accord then the rest of the world, is another push back I've read. We need intelligent answers to these issues. 

And Climate Denial? The Pentagon and NASA have published proof of our impact on Climate Change. We need to counter the vocal deniers.  But we already have the numbers for massive action. There’s a reason why Obama was able to align 197 countries in the Paris Agreement.

We fixed the ozone layer, we've increased fuel efficiency, and safety. We can do this heavy lift, even if it imposes on profit, if it's necessary to support life on freaking earth!

And social media is how Trump won, we can wield it too. It's an insanely powerful force for any movement when the communication is solid.

I'm a biologist in formation, almost finishing my graduation (pretty hard tho) and I thought I wanted to work with environmental biotech, so I'm doing a scientific project in this area and I'm trying do discover a fungi that can degradete glyphosate and 2,4-D (the most common and toxic herbicides in the world). 

But I'm finding myself totally desperate and with no hope at all! Did you guys read the IPCC report on climate change? I started to read the all book but I stopped, it was taking me to a place that I don't really wanna go. 
Basically it looks like there's nothing we can do, only wait for the horrible death with extreme heat and lack of water and food. There's people in the world already living those bad situations... My point here is that the apocalypse is already at the door and we gonna live it. 

So, why would I loose many parts of my life, loose my sanity, loose my great health condition just to do a PhD that no one is going to read, that will change nothing (if there's something to change, bc as I saw on the news IPCC brought to us, there's really nothing we can do), when the world is literally on fire and my life is ending? 
Why would I keep trying? People don't care about. When I talk about how we're f*cked up, people look at me and say that I am crazy or pessimistic. 

Everytime I ask about this for people they tell me things like: but if you do a little, you already did! That's what counts! 

But, really..... Does it make sense to loose all the things I know I would loose to make just a little thing when I know that there's a lot of people suffering from climate change effects, dying, crying, screaming for help? Is like putting a drop on a huge fire... 

Anyways, I'm lost, I wanna give up from everything, I'm tired of seeing the wonderful things in this planet going dead just to keep some 100 dudes rich. But I don't wanna k*ll myself so I need some hope, I need to give a meaning to my life dream again (I dream about being a scientist since I was 5 years old) and that's why I'm here for. 

What do you think about it? What do you think that we, the researchers, should be asking for? How to live in a mad max world? How to support heat and lack of food? How to crop stuff in an complete destroyed environment? 

I really don't know, want some opinions.

&nbsp;

MARCH 30 - 

*General:*

* Coronavirus death rate is lower than previously reported, study says, but it's still deadlier than seasonal flu. The research, published in the medical journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, estimated that about 0.66% of those infected with the virus will die. That coronavirus death rate, which is lower than earlier estimates, takes into account potentially milder cases that often go undiagnosed -- but it's still far higher than the 0.1% of people who are killed by the flu. When undetected infections aren't taken into account, the Lancet study found that the coronavirus death rate was 1.38%, which is more consistent with earlier reports.

*Updates from around the world:*

* Portugal has temporarily given all migrants and asylum seekers full citizenship rights, granting them full access to the country's healthcare as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus escalates in the country.

* Netherlands: In a national address to the Dutch nation on Monday, March 16th, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said his country would aim to develop immunity to the novel coronavirus among its population by allowing large numbers to contract the illness at a controlled pace. In the past week, Rutte has since walked back the herd immunity policy line by introducing what could be characterized as lockdown light.

>A life-cycle feeding study in rats reported negative health effects and found significantly altered blood parameters in animals that were fed Roundup Ready GM maize or were given extremely small amounts of Roundup in the drinking water (Seralini et al., 2012). The authors emphasised the role of pesticide residues in edible herbicide tolerant GM plants and argued that these must be evaluated very carefully to accurately assess potential toxic effects. This study has been criticised for its methods, analysis and reporting by EFSA, which initially rejected the central conclusion of this study, that long term (life-time) toxicity and carcinogenicity studies are needed.

Here are my main problems with GMOs.

1. In the developed world the agricultural market is a train wreck of government interference. We over-produce food, we waste a lot, we  have massive subsides, price supports and various marketing restrictions. Into this mess we add GMOs. They are in my opinion not in any way necessary for developed world consumers. 

2. But they could lower prices! Sure. But not as much as reducing the government interference would. If your primary concern is lower food prices, start with the regulations and trade restrictions.

3. But they reduce pesticide use! They reduce some pesticide use, and increase the use of others.  But the ones they increase could be better than alternatives! Sure. One worse alternative - Atrazine was banned in the EU years ago. And hopefully it will be banned in the US and Canada too eventually. Plus weeds tend to adapt to pesticides. But only if people use the GMOs and pesticides wrongly! True. But people are people. They will always screw up.

4. By GMOs are more profitable! Sure, they are good for agricultural producers. But in the developed world those are already hugely subsidized. Why would I want to help them even more? For a developed world consumer GMOs seem genuinely superfluous at best.


5. Organics use pesticides too! Sure, but I am only aware of two types of grandfathered organic pesticides. First: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotenone
Luckily in the United States and Canada, all uses of rotenone except as a piscicide are being phased out. And second copper sulphates. But copper has very low toxicity. You'd have to consume a huge amount to have any problems. Source: http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/cuso4gen.html

6. But GMOs can help to make things better! Maybe. Recent research indicates genetic engineering lags behind conventional breeding in efforts to create drought-resistant maize: http://www.nature.com/news/cross-bred-crops-get-fit-faster-1.15940  Beyond that, better is relative. The most common tomato in the US is know as bulletproof because it takes a lot of abuse without problems, thus it is easy to transport. For any for-profit company the main focus is profitability.  That profitability results in better tasting, or better in any way foods, only if that is profitable. As ""bulletproof"" tomatoes show, taste is not always on the path to the most profitable type of food.

7. Norman Borlaug!!!

Norman Borlaug is great, and here is why:

Nothing he did involved GMO, it was just traditional breeding.

It was a public project, the resulting seeds were released for free for everyone to use. 

It used pre-existing wheat varieties. He used a Japanese dwarf variety to get stems strong enough to not collapse under the weight of the extra grain.

What's different about GMO:

GMOs tend to be privately funded and owned, and seeds are licensed.

 Mono culture. Where is the next special variety going to come from, if everyone around the world grows the same variety? From where could we quickly borrow a stronger stem from, or natural resistance to a new wheat rust?

    
To me Norman Borlaug is the best possible counter-argument for GMOs. And I have no idea why so many people use him to defend GMOs?






8. But GMO could  help the developing world! Yes, they could help a little But the primary reason for hunger in the developing world is not lack of food, but lack of infrastructure. Source: http://www.wfp.org/hunger/causes Still, I am not against GMOs in places where they actual can help. Which is not in the developed world. I especially like this research: http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/genetics/turbo-tobacco-faster-photosynthesis-17217730 Even if it still missing half the way bacteria photosynthesis works, it is a great start. And a  35-60% increase of crop production could make a major difference even without improvements in transportation.

9. But Golden Rice!!!!

The ""Golden Rice is an effective source of vitamin A"" paper: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/6/1776.full.pdf  Includes the following experimental design:

>Golden Rice plants were grown hydroponically with heavy water (deuterium oxide) to generate deuterium-labeled [2H] b-carotene
in the rice grains. Golden Rice servings of 65–98 g (130–200 g cooked
rice) containing 0.99–1.53 mg b-carotene were fed to 5 healthy
adult volunteers (3 women and 2 men) **with 10 g butter**. 

I guess the butter was necessary since carotenes are hydrophobic, and there needs to be a sufficient amount of fat present in the diet for golden rice (or most other vitamin A supplements) to be able to alleviate vitamin A deficiency. 

Sadly the people in the developing world who suffer from vitamin A deficiency, lack food, especially high caloric food like fatty foods. Thus Golden Rice does not seem like it could help much without more fat in the diet. But fat itself can contain vitamin A, butter has vitamin A. Golden Rice by itself seems insufficient to cure vitamin A deficiency. A varied diet containing foods rich in beta carotene such as sweet potato, leafy green vegetables and fruits could prove just as effective.

The bottom line is that GMOs might be of some help in the developing world, but in the developed world they are at best utterly useless to consumers.

Genetically Engineered Oaks: Development of Fast-Growing Varieties with Easily Edible Acorns

 

Abstract

 

The increasing demand for sustainable agricultural and forestry practices has highlighted the need for innovative approaches to address challenges such as food security, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation. This dissertation explores the potential of genetic engineering to develop oak (Quercus spp.) trees with two specific traits: faster growth rates and production of acorns that are naturally low in tannins, rendering them edible without extensive processing. The proposed project aims to revolutionize the utility of oak trees, providing a dual-purpose crop that contributes to carbon sequestration and offers a novel, nutritious food source.

 

Introduction

 

Oaks are among the most ecologically significant and widespread genera of trees, known for their contributions to forest ecosystems, timber production, and wildlife habitats. Despite their importance, oak trees are underutilized in agroforestry systems due to slow growth rates and the inedibility of acorns, which contain high levels of bitter-tasting tannins. The development of genetically engineered oak varieties could address these limitations, aligning with global sustainability goals.

 

This dissertation proposes a framework for the genetic modification of oaks to achieve the following objectives:

1. Accelerate growth rates to enhance carbon sequestration and timber production.
2. Reduce tannin content in acorns, making them a viable food source for humans and livestock.

 

Literature Review

 

 Oak Tree Biology and Ecology

  Oaks are long-lived trees with a slow maturation process, often taking decades to reach full growth. Their acorns, while rich in carbohydrates and fats, are rendered inedible for most species by tannins, which act as natural anti-herbivory compounds.

 

Advancements in Genetic Engineering

  Recent breakthroughs in CRISPR-Cas9 technology have made it feasible to introduce targeted genetic modifications in plants. Successes in other tree species, such as poplars and pines, provide a roadmap for applying similar techniques to oaks.

 

 Potential Applications of Edible Acorns

 

  Low-tannin acorns could be used in a variety of food products, from flour to animal feed, potentially addressing global food shortages. Additionally, acorns have cultural significance in many regions, making them a valuable resource for revitalizing traditional cuisines.

 

Methodology

 

1. Gene Identification

   \- Utilize genome sequencing to identify genes associated with tannin biosynthesis and growth regulation in oaks.

   \- Perform comparative analysis with related species that exhibit desired traits, such as faster growth or low tannin levels.

 

2. CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing

   \- Design guide RNAs to target key genes involved in tannin production (e.g., polyphenol oxidase genes) and growth regulation (e.g., gibberellin biosynthesis genes).

   \- Introduce edits into oak embryos via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.

 

3. Field Trials and Phenotyping

   \- Conduct controlled field trials to assess the growth rate, acorn tannin content, and ecological interactions of genetically modified trees.

   \- Monitor potential unintended effects, such as reduced pest resistance or changes in soil microbiota.

 

4. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations

   \- Ensure biosafety by keeping genetically modified specimens contained during experimental stages, with planned releases into the environment conducted in strict adherence to national and international guidelines for GMOs.

   \- Engage with stakeholders, including foresters, farmers, and conservationists, to ensure public acceptance and ecological sustainability.

 

Expected Outcomes

\- Development of oak varieties that grow 30-50% faster than conventional counterparts, reducing the time required for timber production and increasing carbon capture potential.

\- Production of acorns with tannin levels reduced by at least 80%, making them suitable for direct consumption or minimal processing.

\- Enhanced adoption of oaks in agroforestry systems, providing economic and ecological benefits.

 

 Discussion

The successful implementation of this project could address several global challenges, including:

\- \*\*Climate Change Mitigation:\*\* Faster-growing oaks would serve as effective carbon sinks.

\- \*\*Food Security:\*\* Edible acorns would provide a novel source of nutrition, especially in regions facing food shortages.

\- \*\*Biodiversity Conservation:\*\* By integrating genetically engineered oaks into landscapes, their ecological roles as keystone species can be preserved and enhanced.

Challenges such as potential ecological risks, public perception of GMOs, and long-term monitoring requirements will be critically evaluated to ensure the project’s success.

 

Conclusion

Genetically engineering oaks to grow faster and produce edible acorns represents a transformative approach to sustainable forestry and agriculture. By leveraging cutting-edge biotechnological tools and addressing key ecological and societal concerns, this project has the potential to make significant contributions to global sustainability efforts. Future research should focus on scaling up successful modifications and integrating these trees into diverse environmental and agricultural contexts.","['Genetically Engineered', 'GMO', 'Genetically Modified', 'food security']",2025-10-15 19:44:49

Thanks for all the food - sincerely!

I'm having a 'discussion', shall we say, on reddit about GMOs, and one of the things I'm being told is that farmers have to pay royalties on GM crops. I thought this was rubbish, but googling it makes me a little confused (of course). Lots of news articles about [royalties and Monsanto](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/13/brazil-monsanto-idUSL1E8HDDUQ20120613) in Brazil, Chile etc. It sounds very odd to me. Can any of you help me understand? I thought royalties would mean a portion of the profit from the harvest, but that sounds ludicrous. Is it really meaning a higher cost for the seed with the trait in it? Wouldn't that be normal?  

Thanks, and I hope you don't mind me posting this sort of question.

edit: (Part of) the original argument I'm having is about GM crops that are being developed in Africa/Asia for specific problems that farmers face in those regions. I'm being told that the seeds will be too expensive and they'll have to pay royalties. I've countered with several examples where that won't be (or already isn't) true - Bt brinjal and  Golden Rice for example.  I'm already a Monsanto shill in that thread ;) but I want to make sure I don't defend something that is true, or perpetuate any myths.

I am pretty critical of anti-GMO people for a lot of reasons, but that seems a bit out there to me. The green revolution has always struggled in most African countries, why would Bt crops or roundup ready corn even be useful in those places?

Had a clearly biased slant, and used lazy smear tactics. 

Focused on big agriculture goals (maximizing yields, distribution, and nutrition) and not on other issues like increasing biodiversity and food diversity, or for conservation efforts.

When it comes to pigs, China is the world's only superpower. However, the Chinese pork industry is under severe threat. A hemorrhagic fever known as African Swine Fever has been decimating herds across Eurasia. Starting from August of 2018, the epidemic struck China [hard](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-swinefever-pig/chinas-pig-herd-may-shrink-by-50-due-to-african-swine-fever-rabobank-idUSKCN1UP068), with some reports suggesting half of China's pigs will be dead by the end of 2019. In today's podcast episode, I will be discussing the rise of China's pork industry, China's struggles in containing African Swine Fever, and the repercussions of this epidemic on the world.

Pigs have been domesticated in China for [approximately ](http://blogs.nature.com/freeassociation/2015/01/on-the-history-of-pigs.html)10,000 years, and has long been the meat of choice for Chinese people. Production methods, at the beginning of the reform era, were simple with small farmers raising a small number of pigs off of waste from the farm. Overall levels of production were low, with total production less than one fifth of what it is today. As China's economy grew rapidly after 1978, the pork industry had to adapt to meet rising demand. The removal of restrictions of farmers activities in the 1980s, the removal of tariffs on imported feed in the 1990s helped small farmers rapidly expand their output. Since the 2000s, government encouraged the creation of giant concentrated agribusiness in order to make meat more traceable and hygeinice standards easier to maintain The average hog farm grew from 945 pigs per farm in 942 to 8,389 in 2009. The Chinese government has encouraged domestic pig farms to expand internationally, with Shuanghui purchasing America's [largest ](https://www.iatp.org/blog/201309/food-and-national-security-the-shuanghui-smithfield-merger-revisited)pork processor in 2013.

As impressive as this growth has been, it is threatened by the rise of African Swine Fever. African Swine Fever is a hemorrhagic fever that can easily spread from pig to pig, whether through feed contaminated with disease, or from close contact between pigs. There is no vaccine or cure for African Swine Fever, although it poses no risk to humans. African Swine Fever kills nearly all pigs infected, and it is expected that half of all Chinese pigs, approximately 220 million pigs, will die or be culled by the [end ](https://www.hoosieragtoday.com/rabobank-african-swine-fever-halve-china-hog-herd/)of 2019. China has instituted a wide array of measures to control African Swine Fever, including checkpoints whenever pigs cross provincial [borders](https://whtc.com/news/articles/2018/nov/23/china-worries-about-hog-supply-as-african-swine-fever-reaches-beijing/), and increased [testing ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-08/slaughterhouse-test-blitz-ordered-to-stem-china-s-pig-contagion)for swine flu at slaughterhouses, and sales for disinfectant have [soared](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3018782/swine-fever-fight-forces-clean-chinas-pig-farms). The practice of feeding pigs farm waste products, often including contaminated meat, has been banned given that [swill ](http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/ASF/2019/Situation_update_2019_05_16.html)feeding was at fault in 62% of outbreaks.

The government however has struggled to implement policies due to a lack of cooperation between the local and central government. Many farmers will try to cover-up outbreaks to avoid a mass culling, lower level local officials have overlooked outbreaks because local governments do not want to [recompense ](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-03-01/lack-of-recompense-could-leave-pig-farmers-struggling-after-swine-flu-101386132.html)farmers for all pigs forcibly culled.

According to official sources, the government has slowed down the spread of African Swine Fever, although outside observers are more [skeptical](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3002717/china-says-it-has-contained-african-swine-fever-cover-claims).

Despite the trade war, American and Canadian pork farmers see a potential opportunity given the scale of Chinese demand. The African Swine Fever could have a longstanding impact on the global environment as well, if the African Swine Fever become endemic to China, and results in a long term [move ](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/poultry-prices-up-amid-swine-fever-in-china.html)to forms of meat that require less feed and do less [damage ](https://slate.com/technology/2009/04/which-meat-harms-our-planet-the-least.html)to the environment such as chicken.

So far in this podcast episode, I have discussed the rise of China's pork industry, the effects of the African Swine Flue on pig production, and the impact of the epidemic on the local and global economies. The African Swine Fever makes it clear, the central role of China in the global economy. A pig epidemic impacts farmers from Benin to Argentina, and is watched by financial analysts around the world. It also makes clear the importance of global cooperation in fighting disease epidemics. The African Swine Fever started from contaminated feed going from Africa to the caucuses mountains, and is continuing to spread [through ](https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/06/20/african-swine-fever-spreads-to-south-east-asia)South East Asia. Fighting African Swine Fever, and other more dangerous diseases, will require international cooperation to control and monitor disease flows.

A couple of months ago, I stumbled across one of my old engineering professor's Twitter accounts and saw him bashing conventional agriculture and promoting organic.  I put together some information for him to challenge his views and make him realize that the issues are not as ""cut and dried"" as he was making them out to be.  I have since shared it with a few other people, and have been encouraged to publish it online.

So, here it goes...


**A bit of background on me....**

I grew up on a family farm in Western Canada.  I studied Mechanical Engineering and graduated with my Bachelor's in 2008.  I had the top marks in my class, and received the Gold Medal in Mechanical Engineering.  I continued at the same university for two more years and completed a thesis-based Master's degree. 

Upon graduating, I worked for a small bio-energy firm  for three years and earned my P.Eng.  After finishing my P.Eng, I made the decision to leave my full time job so I could be more involved with the farm (while I enjoy engineering, the farm has always been my passion).  I continue to practice as an engineer during off-peak times on the farm with a small company that specializes in doing energy audits.

Together with my brother (who has a BSc in Agriculture (Crop Sciences)), my dad, and one full-time employee, we farm approximately 5,250 acres of farmland (roughly 8.2 square miles, or 21.2 square kilometers).  We generally grow wheat, canola, oats and malt barley, all for human consumption (not animal feed).  In a typical year, our farm produces around 8,000 Metric Tonnes of grain (imagine how many people that feeds!).

We employ a wide variety of advanced farming techniques, including zero-tillage farming, GPS auto-steer and sectional control (to avoid over-application of fertilizer and pesticides), GPS yield mapping, variable rate fertilizer applications (to target fertilizer to the areas of the field with high yield potential), and are even experimenting with the use of UAV drones for data collection.

I'm not sure what your views/experience with agriculture are, but I thought I would share some of my views on various topics that seem to come up from individuals that have concerns with modern agriculture.

**Sustainability**

One point that I often see raised is sustainability - many people feel that organic farming is more sustainable than conventional farming.  A couple points I would like to raise on this:

- Does yield factor into your definition of sustainability?  Yields in conventional agriculture are significantly higher than yields in organic farming. A meta-analysis of organic and conventional farming found that yields from organic agriculture are often as much as 34% lower than from conventional agriculture. (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature11069.html?message-global=remove)

When less food is produced from each acre of land, then more land must be brought into production.  The bio-fuels industry received a lot of criticism for causing deforestation of the Brazilian rainforests because so much corn was being used to make ethanol.  Organic farming (which produces less per acre, thus requiring more land) is just as responsible for this.

- Another factor that is often overlooked is nutrients.  One of the biggest environmental impacts of conventional agriculture is the large amounts of energy required to produce synthetic fertilizers.  However, organic farmers are reliant on conventional farmers in this area...

Determining how much fertilizer is required for a crop is a fairly simple mass balance.  The grain we harvest each year contains nutrients.  Thus, each year we must apply enough fertilizer to offset the nutrients we are removing in the grain.  We monitor this over time by having soil from each of our fields tested by a lab every year to ensure that nutrient levels are being maintained.

Organic farmers face this same challenge.  However, organic farming does not allow for the use of synthetic fertilizer.  While crop rotations can be used to satisfy some of their nutrient requirements (crops like peas and beans have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in their roots and take nitrogen from the air and make it available to the plant - and note, conventional farmers utilize this too!), they often apply manure as fertilizer.  That manure is often from animals that have been eating conventional grain (so the nutrients in the manure are from synthetic fertilizer).  A study done in [France](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/4/044045/article) found that 23% of the Nitrogen, 73% of the Phosphorous, and 53% of the Potassium nutrients (the 3 main macro-nutrients) used in organic farming were from synthetic fertilizer.  So in reality, the only difference is that the nutrients that organic farmers use have gone through the digestive tract of a cow ;)

- The last sustainability topic that I want to bring up is tillage.  Over the past 20 years, nearly every acre of grain farmland in Western Canada has been converted to zero-tillage farming.  Each spring, the new crop is seeded directly into the stubble from the previous year's crop with the smallest amount of soil disturbance possible.  This practice has drastically reduced soil erosion, it helps conserve moisture, and it sequesters carbon in the soil (in fact, farmers who adopt this practice in Alberta generate Carbon Offset credits).

I grew up in the 80's, when tillage was still the norm.  To seed our crops, we used to have to make anywhere from 3 to 8 passes over our fields.  The result was soil that was completely pulverized, bone dry, and susceptible to wind erosion.

Nearly all the fence lines in Western Canada have dirt ""drifts"" along them, from soil erosion.  My parents have pictures of me and my sister playing outside when we were young on black snow, since wind had blown soil from nearby fields into our yard.  After a windy day, rural counties used to have to send crews out to dig the soil of of the ditches along the county roads and dump it back on the farmer's fields.

Why do I bring this up?  Organic farmers are utilizing tillage to control weeds.  Still sound more sustainable than conventional farming?

**Pesticides**

Another point that I often see raised is pesticides - here are some thoughts on that...

- First of all, organic farmers use them too.  While they are not allowed to use synthetic pesticides, they are allowed to use naturally occurring ones.  However, as I'm sure you realize, not everything found in nature is ""safe"" or ""less toxic"" than synthetically made things.  Many of the ""natural"" pesticides used in organic farming are more toxic than the synthetic ones used in conventional farming.

[Here](https://twitter.com/DavidKucher/status/602649450310275073/photo/1) is a list of pesticides allowed in organic farming. 

- Newer, safer pesticides are constantly being developed.  Of the three classes of pesticides (herbicides, which control weeds; fungicides, which control plant diseases; and insecticides, which control insects), insecticides are the most dangerous.  We are fortunate in Western Canada that our cold climate does a good job of controlling insects, so we very rarely have to use them.  However, sometimes insect infestations happen and they do need to be used.

One of the major downsides of using an insecticide is that they are non-selective, meaning that they kill ALL insects in the fields (including beneficial insects that feed on the pest insects, and pollinators like bees).  As a result, farmers take the decision to use an insecticide very seriously!

Dupont has recently developed a new insecticide called [Coragen](http://www.dupont.ca/content/dam/assets/industries/agriculture/assets/cp_PSD-67_Coragen_Tech_Bulletin_Canola_E.pdf) which helps address this issue.  Rather than killing insects on contact by attacking their nervous system, the insecticide coats the plants.  When insects eat the plant, the chemical paralyzes their jaws, causing them to starve.  The insecticide has no impact on bees and other beneficial insects.

Rather than being able to embrace new products like this, organic farmers will have to continue using the highly toxic ""natural"" insecticides that they are permitted to use (such as pyrethrin - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethrin)

- Using the least amount of pesticides possible is the goal of all farmers - they are very expensive! (and we are the ones exposed to them in their most concentrated form - using less of them reduces our exposure to them).

All farmers (conventional and organic) practice Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Throughout the year, a wide variety of measures are taken to control pests, with pesticides being only one of them.

Some examples of IPM would include: establishing a healthy plant stand (through proper seeding rates) to enable the plants to out-compete pests, selecting varieties that are resistant to pests (and rotating varieties, to ensure that resistance does not break down), utilizing crop rotations (certain pests target certain crops), and eliminating areas where insects/weeds live/breed (ex: mowing weeds in ditches/abandoned yardsites to prevent them from going to seed). When a pesticide is used, the field is first scouted to verify that it is in fact necessary, the pesticide is applied at the correct rate and at the correct time, and the pesticides used are rotated from year to year to avoid developing resistance).

**GMO's**

Another topic that draws a lot of attention is genetically modified crops (such as in the March Against Monsanto this past weekend).  A few points on them...

- The scientific consensus is that GMO's are safe.  The Pew Research Center polled the membership of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and found that 88% of scientists feel it is safe to eat genetically modified food (which is greater than the 87% consensus that humans are causing climate change).  In contrast, only 37% of the general public feels that GMO's are safe.  This is the largest gap in opinion between scientists and the general public.

- There is more to GMO's than Monsanto.  For example, GMO's saved the Hawaiian papaya industry by developing a variety that was resistant to a disease that nearly wiped out that industry; GMO's are being used to develop orange trees that are resistant to a disease that is threatening the Florida orange industry; GMO's have been used to develop bio-fortified crops, such as Golden Rice; etc.

- GMO's are helping farmers to reduce the use of pesticides.  Bt crops have cut down on the amount of insecticides by making the crops naturally resistant to insect attacks.  Round-up Ready crops (resistant to the herbicide glyphosate) have increased the use of glyphosate; however, glyphosate is less toxic than the herbicides that it has replaced (ie: the herbicides used to control weeds in non-GMO crops).

On our own farm, we grow GMO canola.  The other crops we grow (wheat, oats, and malt barley) are all non-GMO (no GMO varieties are registered for use).  In the past 20 years, our canola yields have doubled (from approximately 25 bushels/acre to 50 bushels per acre), while the amount of herbicides (and their toxicity) we use have decreased.

Yields of our other (non-GMO) crops have increased too, but at a much, much slower rate (in the same period of time, wheat yields would have gone from around 50 bushels/acre to 60 bushels/acre, a 20% increase).

**Monsanto**

A lot of the public's disdain for modern agriculture is directed at Monsanto.  Here are some points on that...

- Growing GMO crops requires farmers to enter into a contract with the company that developed the seed (Monsanto, Bayer, etc - Monsanto is not the only company that makes GMO's).  Farmers are free to choose whether or not to do this (if they don't want to, they can grow non-GMO crops).  However, many farmers do choose to grow them, because the increased yields and other benefits they offer outweigh the additional costs.

One of the terms of the contract is that the farmers must purchase new seed every year.  Farmers often do this regardless of whether they are growing GMO or non-patented non-GMO crops.  Crops bred through hybridization (corn, canola, etc) only exhibit the increased plant vigor they offer for one generation, so new seed must be used each year.  For crops that don't use hybrid breeding (wheat, oats, barley, etc), breeders are constantly releasing new varieties with improved traits (higher yields, disease resistance, etc), so farmers often purchase new seed regularly to take advantage of this.

- Monsanto has never sued farmers for accidental contamination of their crops. (http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/gm-seed-accidentally-in-farmers-fields.aspx).  

They do sue farmers who breach their contract with Monsanto and save seed and replant it without paying royalties - rightly so though! Monsanto spends roughly $1 billion per year on research and development - they need to make a return on that investment.  In addition to that, if they were to allow some farmers to break the rules and not pay royalties, then it puts the farmers who do play by the rules at a disadvantage (since they have higher costs than their neighbors who are not paying the royalty).

- Monsanto is primarily a seed business, not a pesticide manufacturer.  Round-Up (glyphosate) is the only pesticide they manufacture, and it has been off-patent for a number of years.  The majority of the glyphosate used is ""generic"" (ie: made by other companies).

- Organic food is big business too.  Whole Foods (an organic supermarket chain) has yearly sales that are approximately equal to Monsanto's.

**General Comments**

A few random comments...

- ""Corporate"" farms are not big, ""evil"" companies.  My family's farm is a ""corporate"" farm (ie: it is ""incorporated"").  Many family farms do this for tax purposes.  Our farming business pays each of use a wage to live on, and the rest of the farm's profits stay in the farm and are re-invested (in land, machinery, etc).

- Like all things in life, agriculture involves ""balancing"" many competing objectives/goals. Farming requires balancing environmental conservation with the need to feed a growing population (with less labor, since trends are towards increased urbanization) at a reasonable cost (even in ""first world"" countries like Canada there are people who cannot afford to eat proper meals!).

- To me, it is important for farmers to produce food  in the most efficient way possible.  If someone is a small market gardener on the outskirts a city, and they have enough labor to grow everything ""organically"" and feel that those practices make them most efficient, then great! They should absolutely do that! However, suggesting that ALL farming should be organic, when nothing suggests that this is even possible, is a terrible attitude (and one that is only possible for very privileged, first-world urbanites).

- While some ""organic"" farming practices do have merit (as I discussed, there are lots that conventional farmers use too!), organic farming as a whole is too much about conforming to an arbitrary set of ""rules"", rather than doing what is best/most efficient.  Technology is going to continue to develop, and organic farmers are not going to be able to embrace many new things coming down the pipeline (GMO crops bred to be more nutrient/water efficient, insecticides like the one I mentioned that only target pest insects, etc).

- Technology has improved every aspect of our lives - why wouldn't we apply it to farming?  I often wonder if when the ""pro-organic"" people go to the doctor's office if they ask to be treated using technology from 70 years ago?  If not, then why do they do that when they buy food???

- Lastly, I'm going to share a TED talk on agriculture with you.  It was done by an agrologist from Alberta.  I feel it does an excellent job articulating the challenges affecting modern agriculture.  Of all the links I have shared in this email, this is the one I would most encourage you to check out :)

**Seed Treatment Fungicides Market: Introduction**

Seed treatment can be defined as treating seeds with additionally required chemicals such as Imidaclorpid 48% FS, Metalaxyl 35 WS, and others, that are used to biologically improve the seeds quality and protect the seeds. This process is used in order to control diseases and infections caused owing to soil borne infections, false smut, fungal disease, blight and root rot, termite bunt, and loose smut, among others. Fungicide seed treatments aids in protecting seedlings from getting effected due to both seed pathogens and soil. Seed-borne pathogens are those accommodated on the seed surface, or those located in the inner part of the seed. Soil-borne pathogens contaminates the seed or seedling, which is the main cause of the growth of both non-parasitic and parasitic diseases.

**Market Dynamics**

Some of the major factors driving the seed treatment fungicides market include the increasing demand for genetically modified seeds, coupled with rising use of fungicides for crop protection is fueling the market growth. As the fungicides ensure high farm yields, and also improve the protection from harmful organisms, the demand for seed treatment fungicides is expected to grow. Moreover, increasing demand for feedstock such as farming seeds will further enhance the product demand over the projected period.

The market is expected to restrain due to the increasing use of treated seeds among farmers. According to Agricultural Health Study (AHS), more than 90% of farmers in North Carolina and Iowa use seed treated seeds only, while very few farmers are using fungicides for seed treatment. Moreover, according to FAO stats, Iowa led the U.S. corn production in 2015, which was followed by Nebraska and Illinois. Both these states produced over 2 billion corn crop bushels in 2015, while states such as Indiana and Minnesota produced only 1 billion corn bushels in 2015.

**Market Segmentation**

The seed treatment fungicides market has been categorized into crop type, product type, process, form and geography. On the basis of crop type the market is segmented into integrated cereals & grains, oil seeds, fruits & vegetables, flowers & ornaments Seed. Based on product type the market is categorized into captan, difenoconazole, biological agents, carboxin, and PNCB among others. Seed treatment fungicides market based on process is divided into seed coatings fungicides, seed dressing fungicides and seed pelleting fungicides among others. Form segment is segmented into powder and liquid. Seed dressing fungicides is the most regularly used technique, this is majorly due to easy procedure and low cost when compared to others. Economical earthen pots are used for mixing chemicals with seeds otherwise seed can be spread on a polythene sheet and essential quantity of chemical can be sprinkled over the seeds and mixed automatically by the farmers with the help of machinery. Seed dressing fungicides technique is basically a biological process, which is being used in various crop types such as in pigeon pea, sugarcane, chilies and tomatoes among others.

**Regional Analysis**

North America accounted for the largest market share in 2017. Strict government regulations towards curbing and reducing the use of agrochemicals such as pesticides along with growing consumer awareness regarding the presence of fertilizer remains in the produce, has resulted in a substantial growth in demand for seed treatment fungicides. As per the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA); seedling-blight diseases and smuts caused in barley, wheat, oats, and others can be controlled by seed treatment fungicides, that helps to kill the infections causing diseases inside the seed during germination. Asia Pacific market is anticipated to be experience a swift growth in the seed treatment fungicides market over the forecast period. According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, in 2017, India and China are the key producers of wheat globally. As per a article published by FAO in 2017 India produced 93.34 million tons of wheat in 2017.

\- Rice yields dropped 20%

\- Tea exports collapsed

\- Food inflation reached 55%

Not because organic is bad, but because large-scale transitions need:

• Farmer training

• Soil recovery time

• Economic buffers

• Climate resilience

• Certification reform

What are the downsides of organic farming of diverse vegetable farming, not just a specialized farming of certain crops? Is it even done?

It just doesn’t seem to be done easily when farming in itself is not an easy field to work in. Especially with larger family farms that grow a large diversity of vegetable/fruit crop, not necessarily just dairy, grain, meat, orchards, etc. where their focus is in one general area. I truly mean medium to large size diverse crop farming, not backyard hobby farming that would be a bit easier to maintain organic practices. The labor costs will be driven up exponentially just to replace what pesticides and insecticides can do on such a grand scale. But the guilt of product use and its environmental impact is also overwhelming in its own way.

If organic farming is not as easily done on a larger scale, what are sustainable practices that a large farming operation can implement? What are resources that are legit to look into to implement more sustainable practices if 100% organic is just not possible? Practices I would love to learn about are composting/how to turn into fields for nutrient rich soil, different synthetic vs. natural pesticides/insecticides (save the pollinators supporter), if organic farming is done with large scale operations that are not specialized…

He has owned this farm since 1994 but never really had anything to show for it so far despite being very dedicated. He has plenty of passion for farming and the planet (being organic), but he falls short in the business side of things. He will also turn 69 in a few months and I feel the energy he is able to provide is faltering. For instance, it seems to me he sometimes foregoes the right decision out of complacency. For instance, our filtering system (not sure if that is the right term) broke down 9 years ago and he did not bother to get it fixed, meaning he either had to outsource the cleaning of the produce (incurring extra costs) or sell it cheaper. We already decided to get it fixed before the next harvest. Another example is that he has a lot of no longer used machines laying around but never gets around to seling them. I will also help him with that. Besides such interventions, I want to put my scientific thinking ability to work in order to make well-informed decisions. Such as what crops to grow each year, etc. He has a wealth of information, but I suspect he and other farmers do not take advantage of all information that is out there.

Look, I’m no spring chicken. My mom grew up on a small subsistence farm in an early 20th century midwestern state. No electricity, no indoor plumbing, no phone, no motorized equipment. Machinery was pulled by horses and oxen.

Her brother, my uncle, had a mid-20th century farm where he had maybe 30 head of cattle and dairy cows, a dozen or so pigs, and maybe 40 chickens at any given time. Not much but he also grew corn and beans, hay, etc. Today you’d probably call it an “organic” farm, or close to that. He had to work off-farm on the side to make ends meet.

I am writing a persuasion speech for my speech class and I have a question for those who are more educated in this area. My speech is about persuading the class that we are in desperate need of moving from factory farming to localized organic farms for various reasons. 

The structure of my speech is stating the problem, i.e factory farms, chemically intensive, inhumanly raised livestock, and monoculture crops. Then the cause of these problems, followed by the solution to these problems. Where I ran into trouble is developing the ""cause"" of the factory farming, which is what lead me here... What caused factory farming to become what is is today? Could it be lack of transparency, capitalism?

Help me out people! Thank you for any and all help.

It summarizes three practices seen in trials/extension reports and on farms:

• Legume grass leys (living soils): home-grown N, better water infiltration, lower nitrate leaching  
• Legume cereal rotations: disease breaks, steadier rotation-average yields  
• Boreal hedgerows/windbreaks: microclimate shelter; spacing matters to avoid shade losses

Reality check from temperate/boreal growers/agronomists:

* Crop + t/ha ranges you’re seeing under long leys (any rotation lengths that clearly help?)  t/ha replies welcome)
* Seed rates + termination methods for overwintering living-mulch mixes (Zone 3–4)
* Windbreak spacing/orientation that nets positive (row spacing; N–S vs E–W; species)
* Where the economics flip for green manures vs compost vs purchased inputs (€/t or €/ha)

For those who don’t know, SIL has been a big player in global agricultural development, specifically for tropical soybeans. This decision means 30 experts are losing their jobs, but it’s not just about them. The ripple effects of this are way bigger.

For starters, SIL was one of 19 innovation labs working across the U.S. land-grant university system. These labs weren’t just sitting around—they were delivering real, measurable impact with minimal investment. U.S. soybean farmers are losing one of their best tools for expanding into international markets and upholding U.S. agricultural standards. Emerging economies that relied on soybeans for food security and economic growth are also taking a major hit.

And here’s the kicker: programs like this often get unfairly lumped into “wasteful spending” narratives. Yes, there are cases of inefficiency or even fraud in public programs, but not everything is a scam. SIL was directly collaborating with businesses, governments, and organizations on the ground to solve real problems like poverty and food insecurity. Cutting this funding won’t just save a few dollars—it’s setting back years of progress.

Think about it: local economies lose a crop that’s been a lifeline. International stability takes a hit because food insecurity is a major driver of unrest and migration. And the U.S.? We lose influence in key global markets and regions where we’ve been able to build goodwill through projects like these.

Maybe this kind of funding isn’t flashy or exciting, but it’s foundational. If we keep axing programs like SIL, who’s really winning here?

Would love to hear your thoughts—especially if you’ve got insight into how these programs actually operate.",['food security'],2025-10-15 19:45:06

My goal is to scale up to commercial farming and create value-added products from my produce. I’m considering options like Khapli wheat flour, multigrain mixes, or even ready-to-eat healthy products.

I’d love to hear your ideas and suggestions on where I should focus as it will take 3-4 month to harvest  . What factors should I consider while developing and selling these products?

I would just like to ask if any countries other than Japan accepted the new Cavendish breed GCTCV 219 is sweeter than the normal Grand Naine and Williams breed but has lower yield and varying banana finger sizes. 

The new breeds GCTCV 218 and  219 were created to fight the extinction of current bananas because of the pandemic caused by the fusarium wilt. They're from Taiwan. Compared to the normal Grand Naine and Williams, they're taller and more expensive for farmers as they require more care. They also have a longer harvest cycle time and shorter lifespan compared to GN and Williams. As far as I know Australia also has an experimental breed been approved this year for planting.

Does anyone know or has a link to any literature regarding specifications of Cavendish fruits for export grade to Japan, Korea, China and others? 

I'm having trouble looking for specs and papers as most of the papers and I found were In Favor of these new varieties. Though not as replacements but for rehabilitation of plantations infected with the disease.

This is conflicting with the statements from actual farmers we interviewed who told us that these new variants are Not Export Grade. We've been looking for leads for the past two weeks 😭.

EU I think has a very strict ban on GMO's?

Unsure if this is okay to ask here, but I have a question for agriculturists about the worldbuilding for the fantasy novel I'm writing. 

Essentially, in the near future, an astro-agriculturist ends up in a seperate universe with an earth-like planet when her spacecraft experiences a catastrophic failure while en route to be the first colony on an inhabitable planet within our universe. Long story short (this Is the B Plot/background of the novel lol), she finds a human society that is pre-industrial revolution but post-agricultural-revolution (ie. have organised farming), and teaches them some Really Fucking Optimised Ways To Farm Sustainably And Regeneratively (think aquaponics, vertical farming, agroforestry, permaculture, etc). This leads to the formation of an empire that she is the head of, and following her death, she becomes deified and a religion is formed around her, and the society that remains is very powerful and VERY good at gardening and farming. 

The main events of the narrative take place around nine hundred years following this, maybe a bit more, and the church of the agriculturist is VERY powerful and very heavily involved with the pseudo-feudalist monarchy. The empire still exists--the capital city is situated about 60 km from the coastline in a temperate, oceanic climate around a lot of low mountains in a large granite intrusion of plateaus etc--and dominates crop production in that area of the world. One of my main characters is the equivalent of a priest, and specialises in research and development of gardening technology as a kind of holy duty.

Site is a water logging area but if there is excess rain for that season.(only for a month or 2 at Max). I am from state odisha,india  in addition to that it is near coastal area which is a frequently cyclone prone.

I've been working as a frontend web developer in the finance world for a couple years now. It's been fun, I've learned a ton, but there are a lot of important problems to solve out there, and the problems of the finance world are ranking lower and lower on my list as other more pressing things, climate change especially, start to get more urgent and dire.

Software engineering is an occupation that has so much power to influence and shape the world in exciting and important ways, so I'm trying to do some research on areas where I could use my SE skills to start pushing the world towards a more sustainable future.

Sustainable agriculture is one thing that excites me in particular. I've always really liked the story of the Haber process, which is how we extract nitrogen from the atmosphere to use as fertilizer, which in turn is one of the main reasons why we can feed 9 billion people on this planet today. It's such a cool case study for how science can improve the world, and software is another tool which can impact food production in a positive way. 

I'm hoping that you all have some advice on getting into the industry from the software side of things, or maybe have some interesting directions for me to look in as I figure out the lay of the land. Companies, job titles, tech stacks, even anything tangentially related to the industry would be golden as I try to figure out which way is up! Self driving tractors, weather satellites, AI, I am all ears. 

For some context: I'm currently living in NYC, although I'm looking to relocate within the US, especially the west.

I recently took a biology class for the first time since I was in high school and I have never been so excited about what I was learning about (other than classes that I don’t think I could make a career out of – philosophy and music). Since the class ended, I’ve been itching to learn and do more with soils, especially soil microbiology, but I have no idea where to even start. I’ve become convinced that reforming our agricultural practices and focusing on soil health is one of the most important things we can do to fight climate change and protect our water resources (and more!).

Hello,

I  work in a winery in Italy and in the past we have offered our land to universities and other organizations to research sustainable  agricultural methods and increase certain aspects of knowledge in that area. We are an organic farm that is quite highly rated within the wine  world and is in an area that is very famous for its wine (I don't know  if that is of any value, just thought it could give additional views for  whoever does the research)

Over the next year, we are going to be planting some new vineyards and were interested to work alongside a university or organization to investigate and apply new sustainable farming methods. This year for example we are trying to investigate how an agroforestry approach may aid the development of arousal mycorrhizal networks in the subsoil. We would like to supply the next plot of land to research with another project where the plot could be studied from when it is uncultivated to years down the line when it is productive.

So far I have been having difficulty navigating through the masses of ongoing projects funded by the European Union. Would you guys know if there is somewhere I could sign my farm up as being interested in participating in ongoing research on the development of sustainable agricultural methods? We are not interested in the funding, it is rather that we would love to offer what we have to help academia with the development of sustainable agriculture.

If you have any advice I would be extremely grateful.

I hope that I am not in the wrong subreddit for this question, but I was unsure where else to ask.",['sustainable agriculture'],2025-10-15 19:45:08

Much has changed in agriculture since the end of World War II. Food and fiber productivity has risen sharply thanks to new technologies, mechanization, greater use of chemicals, specialization, and government policies that support maximizing production and lowering food prices. These changes have allowed fewer farmers to produce more food and fiber at lower prices.

Although these developments have a positive impact on agriculture and reduce many risks, they also have significant costs. Most important are land depletion, groundwater pollution, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, declining family farms, neglect of living and working conditions of agricultural workers, new health threats, and human survival due to the spread of new pathogens, concentration in the food industry. and the collapse of farms and rural societies.

Over the past four decades, there has been a growing movement to challenge the demand for these high costs and offer innovative alternatives. Today, this sustainable agricultural movement is increasingly supported and welcomed in our food production systems. Sustainable agriculture has three main objectives: environmental health, economic sustainability, and social equality.

Various philosophies, policies, and practices have contributed to these goals, but some common themes and principles are included in most definitions of [sustainable agriculture](https://digiworldofagriculture.blogspot.com/2022/03/Sustainable-Agriculture-For-Future.html).",['sustainable agriculture'],2025-10-15 19:45:08

And the latest update is that the court just approved the agreement.  So here’s a little recap.

Back in 2016 (almost 10 years now, btw) Bayer announced plans to buy Monsanto, claiming that all issues connected to Roundup had been properly vetted. But once the deal closed in 2018, a California jury awarded $289M in the first Roundup cancer trial.

More massive verdicts followed, and Bayer’s reassurances about risk management started to look questionable (at least, lol). 

After all of this happened, $BAYRY plunged 11%, and investors filed a lawsuit claiming that the company ignored the potential cost of the Roundup situation and hid key info from shareholders ahead of one of the largest acquisitions in pharma-agriculture history.

Now, Bayer has finally agreed to a $38M payout to resolve the claims, and the court just approved the settlement. So if you invested back then, you can check the details and [file a claim](https://11th.com/cases/bayer-investor-settlement) to get payment.

Since the War in Ukraine began in early 2022, commodity prices have been falling. The disinflationary trend was helped by the fastest rate hiking cycle in central bank history. The disappointing China reopening and lackluster demand for agricultural commodities have told buyers to wait and the prices will come to them.

In the last four weeks, energy markets have shifted from a neutral to a bullish trend, catching speculators short. Energy supplies are not keeping up with demand after several years of underinvestment. It is not a supply shock or demand outperformance right now, but rather a misallocation of capital toward green energy that cannot make up the 2 million barrels per day shortfall. The world is still using more oil.

End users and governments have been rewarded by going hand-to-mouth. This means waiting until the last minute to buy commodities, and substituting out the more expensive ones whenever possible. It is the right strategy when prices are falling, but it can cause severe supply disruptions when food commodities are difficult to source. Said differently, it becomes high-risk when food and agriculture prices start rising. There is a risk of higher commodity prices in 2024.

Food commodities, no counting grains, have stayed persistently high in Europe due to weather events causing production problems. Spain, Eastern Europe, and Germany have had independent weather problems over the last year. Wheat prices have been under pressure in Europe due to poor demand and last year’s large crop.

Other parts of the world are facing weather events as well. Typhoons in China’s northeast, India’s uneven monsoon, Canada’s persistent drought, and Argentina’s multi-year La Nina have tightened stocks around the globe.

Individual commodities such as rice and wheat may be developing their own bullish stories. These are food staples that countries need to feed their people. If there is a potential food and grain supply issue on the horizon, governments and end users are going to have to reconsider their buying habits.

India is one of the world’s largest producers, exporters, and consumers of rice, wheat, sugar, and ethanol. These markets are each developing their own bullish fundamentals. See the article below that dives deeper into the India wheat situation.",['food security'],2025-10-15 19:45:12

Canada is the Latest.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/1f8u8xg/farmers_are_caught_in_the_middle_of_expanding/,,,,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/1f8u8xg/farmers_are_caught_in_the_middle_of_expanding/,EasyNewzApp,Agriculture,2024-09-04 16:07:42,2.0,2.0,0.6,"Farmers Are Caught in the Middle of Expanding Protectionism. Canada is the Latest.



Last week, Canada imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, steel, and aluminum to protect domestic production. Chinese EVs surged to $2.3 billion, or 13.3% of all EV imports in 2023. The Trudeau government announced tariffs on China and stricter immigration laws days apart. The pushback from Canadians to his administration’s far-left policies has forced a sudden reversal in Ottawa.



The Biden administration followed Canada’s lead days later with 100% tariffs of its own. BYD, the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, announced it would wait until after the US elections to proceed with its new plant in Mexico.



China is deeply dissatisfied with the outcome, and it took China less than a week to fire back.



“China strongly deplores and firmly opposes the discriminatory unilateral restrictive measures taken by Canada against its imports from China despite the opposition and dissuasion of many parties,” a commerce ministry spokesperson said in a statement.



On September 3, China’s Commerce Ministry announced an anti-dumping probe into Canadian Canola that harmed domestic producers. The investigation is likely to take months, but the outcome is clear. Canadian agriculture will pay the price if Canada stands by its tariff hikes.



In the short term, buyers will front-run restrictions, leading to a potential surge in fourth-quarter imports following the sell-off. In the long term, Canada will need to replace the second-largest market for Canadian canola and the largest market for bulk Canadian ag exports. This will hurt domestic producers and weigh on prices. Farmers may need to consider alternative crops in 2025.



Farmers worldwide are exposed to geopolitics and protectionism spilling over into agriculture and food. Australian farmers were caught between Canberra and Beijing after Covid. American farmers received the lowest prices of the modern era during Trump’s trade war.



Protectionism is on the rise globally, and both US candidates’ platforms aim to expand the use of tariffs for critical industries. Agriculture and farmers will end up caught in the middle at a time when most governments are already struggling to support farm income.",[],2025-10-15 19:45:14

Specifically, I'm looking for articles that look at future predictions/trends in growing season temperature, precipitation, and extreme climatic situations (i.e. flood/drought/heat wave periods), but am also interested in articles that look at the availability of freshwater or even something like farm land loss due to sea level rise.

,,,212ym4,,,Eating Injured Chickens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/212ym4/eating_injured_chickens/,,,,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/212ym4/eating_injured_chickens/,need-thneeds,Agriculture,2014-03-22 18:01:52,9.0,5.0,0.92,"There is nothing better than a good home made chicken soup. The taste can't be beat and the idea of stretching a good sized chicken out over a week of meals for a family of four gives me a warm fuzzy feeling of goodness. 

But last night I noticed something about the chicken I bought that may or may not be an issue. My wife has recently started working again so more of the shopping and cooking has come to my side of the relationship. At the store there was a choice between ""Locally Grown"" vs. ""Grain Fed"". The local grown was about 20% more expensive so I bought ""Grain Fed"" with the presumption that it was raised and processed in a large facility and shipped to supplement the locally grown food supply.

I'm no expert in forensic analysis of chicken carcases... however after our roast chicken dinner, while picking the remaining meat in preparing the carcase for boiling I noticed that the backbone appeared bent and splintered, there also appeared to be some healing that had occurred with lumpy build ups of bone around the splinter. The meat around this location was more of a brownish colour to about 3/4"" deep. My conclusion is that this chicken suffered an injury but continued to live for some time before finally being slaughtered.

Normally we buy local, or eat our own chickens. We have a wonderfully run, clean local processing facility that slaughter and dress the birds for a small fee. I have observed their process and they are doing it right. But just the same, injuries happen, I had one chicken that suffered a broken leg by an overzealous 13 year old neighbour who was left in charge of our flock. Although the chicken was still limping around, I decided that we should eat it and we did. But we removed and discarded the bruised meat from the broken leg.

Industrial agriculture may be necessary considering the present state of the world, and a good bulk of my experience and income has been from involvement in industry. I'm quite aware of how these facilities operate, the good and the bad.

My simple question is: Are there any ill effects from eating chicken meat from an injured chicken?

There is a more difficult question here. Why are so many individuals who are involved in agriculture, reluctant to consume the very products that are produced by these huge facilities?

Last week, [researchers announced at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing that they had altered the genomes of twin girls](https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/26/claim-of-crispred-baby-girls-stuns-genome-editing-summit/) using [CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YKFw2KZA5o) approaches. This marks the first time that we know of that this technology has been used to modify humans.

He Jiankui had previously presented work on genome editing in human, monkey, and mouse embryos at a scientific meeting in 2017, but he had made no indication at the time that he intended to use the altered embryos to initiate a pregnancy.

Based on the announcement last week, He Jiankui’s institution, Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, issued a statement indicating that it had been unaware of the research and that this work had “seriously violated academic ethics and codes of conduct.” Rice University [has also launched an ethics investigation](https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/26/rice-university-opens-investigation-into-researcher-who-worked-on-crisprd-baby-project/) into He Jiankui's doctoral advisor and collaborator, Michael Deem, who is a professor in bioengineering.

The research has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed paper, so many details of the results remain unknown at this time. It is important to note that gene editing with CRISPR is also being actively pursued in the United States to help correct severe genetic diseases - the company Editas Medicine [recently received FDA approval](https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/30/editas-crispr-trial/) for a clinical trial for a CRISPR-based treatment for LCA10, a rare form of blindness.

To answer your questions about this news we have guests from George Church’s lab at Harvard who are experts in gene editing technology, and a prominent ethicist from Vanderbilt University.

It's been a busy year for stem cells including many ups, downs, and just plain crazy stuff going on, particularly in the last few months. Stem cell clinics are proliferating around the US like mushrooms. The FDA hasn't said much on how it plans to regulate these clinics. Stem cell treatments are being offered for just about everything. The academic stem cell field has seen too many paper retractions including most notoriously the STAP or so-called acid bath stem cell papers. One of the authors of the STAP papers just recently committed suicide. 


Meanwhile, much stem cell research is exciting, encouraging, and rock solid. People are realistically talking about stuff like using stem cells in coming years and decades to replace entire limbs, treat many serious diseases, regrow hair, give you a better sex life, and much more. How much of this is real? What's on your mind about stem cells? Have you gotten a stem cell treatment? Considering one? Ask my anything about stem cells!

I’m Mark Blaskovich, the Program Coordinator for Hit Validation & Chemistry for the Community for Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery (CO-ADD, see www.co-add.org). I’m also a Senior Research Officer at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at The University of Queensland in Australia. The goal of CO-ADD is to empower the community of synthetic chemists to discover new antibiotics. We provide free screening against five bacteria and two fungi, and are actively seeking out compounds to test from chemists around the world. Any compounds that show activity undergo further assays, and all the results are the property of the compound submitter.
 
My background is medicinal chemistry – I got my PhD in synthetic chemistry developing syntheses of unusual amino acids, and published a book on amino acid synthesis (Handbook on Syntheses of Amino Acids, Oxford University Press). I worked for ten years for a couple of biotech companies in Seattle, a peptidomimetic company developing GPCR ligands and protease inhibitors (Molecumetics) and a company focused on protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (CEPTYR).  I then crossed the ocean to become Chief Operating Officer at Mimetica (Australia), where I managed the drug discovery and development program for melanocortin-5 receptor antagonists. This work led to a compound currently in Phase II human trials for the treatment of acne. Since 2010 I’ve been working at The University of Queensland, developing new antibiotics to treat drug resistant pathogens and helping to set up CO-ADD. I’ll be giving a talk about CO-ADD and our antibiotic discovery efforts at the [C&EN virtual symposium on Advances in Drug Discovery and Development on Sept 16](http://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=782&seid=1319&code=CENEmail1).
 
**I will be back at 5 pm ET (2 pm PT, 9 pm UTC, 7 am in Queensland!)**  Please AMA about CO-ADD, and what you can do to help to discover new antibiotics!

Hi all, I'm online now and will start answering questions. I see there's a lot of interest already, which is fantastic. If I don't get to your question during this session, I'll come back to it later today (it's bright and early in Australia now)!  MB 

Hi again - thanks for all your questions. Unfortunately I have to check out, but I''ll be back in a couple of hours and keep working my way through, so please check back to see if your question has been answered. Also, please watch my presentation next week at the [C&EN virtual symposium on Advances in Drug Discovery and Development on Sept 16](http://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=782&seid=1319&code=CENEmail1) to learn more about CO-ADD and how you can help discover the next antibiotic.

Essentially, CAR-T cells are T-cells taken from a patient, engineered to recognize and destroy the patient's tumor, and then put back in the body to kill the cancer cells.

The CAR-T concept has been exciting researchers for several years now, but clinical studies were typically small and mostly focused on testing the safety of the technology. [Last night, KITE Pharma released new data from their ongoing pivotal (meaning intended to be used to apply for FDA approval) phase II study](http://ir.kitepharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=990947) using CAR-T cells in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The results were very impressive. KTE-C19 (the CAR-T drug) met the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR), p < 0.0001, with an ORR of 76 percent, including 47 percent complete remissions (CR). Historically, standard of care has an 8% CR rate for these patients.

While very exciting, there are still several concerns with the technology: namely safety, and duration of remission.

A number of patients experienced adverse events related to the drug, and two died as a result of treatment. Additionally, while 47% of patients experienced a complete remission, some had relapsed three months later.

We use directed evolution to engineer proteins to do chemistry not found in nature (yet). Let's Discuss!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/9myt6l/science_discussion_we_are_researchers_at_caltech/,,,,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/9myt6l/science_discussion_we_are_researchers_at_caltech/,ScienceModerator,science,2018-10-10 14:00:22,4721.0,292.0,0.93,"Hi Reddit,

We are graduate students and postdocs in Professor Frances Arnold's research group at Caltech. We use directed evolution, the algorithm for which Frances won the Nobel Prize last week, as a tool to engineer proteins.

Directed evolution, like Darwinian evolution, is about ""survival of the fittest"" by selecting beneficial mutations that enhance a desired function. The key difference is that in directed evolution the person running the experiment chooses which mutations are beneficial – in other words, we choose the definition of ""fittest"" in ""survival of the fittest.""

Understanding how a protein's sequence connects to its structure is challenging ([relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1430/)), and understanding how that structure confers function is another significant challenge. A strength of directed evolution is that one does not need to know a lot about the protein to use it; all one needs is the genetic information (the DNA that encodes the protein of interest) and a way of testing each variant for the function of interest. We don't need to know exactly how or why the protein is able to catalyze a reaction or understand why a mutation enhances that activity.

Proteins have been engineered using directed evolution for myriad uses, from higher stability for use in your laundry detergent to remove stains to producing blockbuster pharmaceutical compounds in place of less environmentally friendly syntheses.

Unfortunately Frances is not able to join us for the discussion, but we are happy to answer any questions you have about directed evolution, proteins, Caltech, and beyond!

First, thanks for your contributions to make /r/science one of the largest, if not the largest, science forums on the internet, we are constantly amazed at the quality of comments and submissions.

We know this is an issue that stirs up a lot of emotion in people which is why we wanted to bring it to you, it's important, and we want important issues to be discussed openly and in a civil manner.

Some background:  

**I approached Monsanto about doing an AMA**, Monsanto is not involved in manipulation of reddit comments to my knowledge, and I had substantial discussions about the conditions we would require and what we could offer.

We require that our AMA guests be scientists working in the area, and not PR, business or marketing people. We want a discussion with people who do the science.

We offer the guarantee of civil conversation.  Internet comments are notoriously bad; anonymous users often feel empowered to be vicious and hyperbolic.  We do not want to avoid hard questions, but one can disagree without being disagreeable.  Those who cannot ask their questions in a civil manner (like that which would be appropriate in a college course) will find their comments removed, and if warranted, their accounts banned.  /r/science is a serious subreddit, and this is a culturally important discussion to have, if you can't do this, it's best that you not post a comment or question at all.

Normally we restrict questions to just the science, since our scientists don't make business or legal decisions, it's simply not fair to hold them accountable to the acts of others.

However, to his credit, Dr. Perlak has agreed to answer questions about both the science and business practices of Monsanto because of his desire to directly address these issues.  Regardless of how we personally feel about Monsanto, we should applaud his willingness to come forward and engage with the reddit user base.

The AMA will be posted tomorrow morning, with answers beginning at 1 pm ET to allow the user base a chance to post their questions and vote of the questions of other users.  

We look forward to a fascinating AMA, please share the link with other in your social circles, but when you do please mention our rules regarding civil behavior.

Thanks again, and see you tomorrow.

Today's discussion is coming to us from the [**National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM)**](http://www.nationalacademies.org/) and is a collaboration between r/science, [**LabX**](https://labx.org/), and [**the Water, Science and Technology Board**](http://dels.nas.edu/wstb)! 

## We are panel of diverse water science professionals ready to answer your questions about all things related to drinking water. 

Water is a ubiquitous phenomenon! But its visual abundance—from its constant flow out of taps and fountains to the immensity of our oceans—can mask the fact that 1 in 7 people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water (that’s over 1 billion people!). Furthermore, in places like New Orleans or The Netherlands, water can seem like an impending threat without the proper means to safely contain it, or productively incorporate it into our daily lives. The broader water/society interface raises questions about drinking water’s vulnerability to climate change and society’s vulnerability to ageing infrastructure for adequate and safe sourcing, treatment, and distribution. Poor drinking water quality can result from pollution from sources such as industrial waste, agricultural runoff, corrosion of lead from distribution pipes, or treatment facility contamination by man-made materials such as polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Emerging innovations in grey/green infrastructure, stewardship programs to reduce man-made contaminants, desalination technology, and international efforts to increase access to safe water on a global scale might help preserve and increase Earth’s water supply and society’s value of it. All of these issues, and more, are on our collective radar and we look forward to discussing them with you. Ask us anything! 

Our discussion panel guests today are:

I'm Devin Peterson. I earned a doctoral degree in Flavor Chemistry (2001) at the University of Minnesota. In 2001, I joined the faculty in the Department of Food Science at Penn State University for eight years. In 2004, I received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), presented by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy as the nation’s highest recognition of scientific professionals at the start of their independent research careers. In 2009, I joined the University of Minnesota as an Associate Professor and was promoted to Professor in 2014. In 2011, my team and I developed the [Flavor Research and Education Center]( http://frec.osu.edu/), an academic-industry consortium whose mission is, in part, to work with the food industry as a whole to develop healthier food choices with higher product acceptability. I recently relocated my research program and FREC to The Ohio State University as part of the discovery themes initiative, a unique investment in agriculture research.  My  research efforts focus on food flavor and related chemistry with particular emphasis on flavor characterization (taste, aroma, chemesthetic, mouthfeel), flavor generation, taste-aroma interactions and modulation, and flavor delivery.
 


I am Gary Reineccius, Ph.D, currently the longest tenured faculty member in the Department of Food Science and Nutrition at University of Minnesota – Twin Cities; I have been actively involved in flavor research for more than 46 years. During this time I have published over 230 research articles; spent sabbatical leaves with Fritzsche Dodge and Olcott, Nestle, and Robertet S.A.; and taught formal courses in Food Chemistry, Food Analysis, Food Processing I and II, Current Issues, Flavor Technology, and Flavor Chemistry. There are few areas related to food flavors that I have not conducted research on. My greatest interest currently lies in flavor encapsulation, emulsions and flavoromics (chemometrics as applied to flavor chemistry). 


We are ready have some fun and answer questions.  Devin

As someone who started off as a drug designer in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries I have always had a keen interest in natural products. Consequently I have worked for many years in the use of plant and natural products for things like improving human health, colours, food ingredients, shelf life extension etc. Over the last decade or so I have become passionate about fully utilizing crops and plants and am leading efforts into promoting and realizing a circular economy approach to agriculture and industry. A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible and get the most use out of them, then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life. Can we take this forward in plant and crops science, and industries?

I think sustainability is key to our continued survival and lifestyles. I am on the Sense About Science’s Plant Science Panel (http://bit.ly/plantpanel), where you can put questions and opinions for response from researchers. The Panel is made up of over 50 independent plant science researchers. You can ask questions to them on Twitter (@senseaboutsci #plantsci) Facebook or using this online form. Answers are sent back within a couple of days and posted online. The Panel has answered close to 400 questions over the last three years and it's a great want to cut through the noise around what can sometimes be a really polarised debate.

I am currently in the process of making a back-up plan. 

My line of work has been unstable lately and I am considering stepping back into the restaurant industry. 

Opening a small 50-seat restaurant would be ideal as I would be willing to work my heart out if it was my own.  

In my current city, we do not have an authentic Greek restaurant. It is hard to believe as there are quite a few Greeks with restos here, but none have been willing to gamble by going full authentic even though I believe the city has a demand for it. You can find bits of Greek cuisine scattered on menus across the city and for the most part, 90% of it is garbage.

(Who in the f**k uses cherry tomatoes in a Greek salad?)

It blows my mind.

So r/food... 

Which Greek dishes do you expect and love to see on a menu when you visit an authentic place? 

I look forward to your suggestions and discussion.

Thanks for your time.

P.S. - I live next to the sea. I have access to fresh local lamb and organic farm fresh poultry. Veggies in winter.... yikes.",[],2025-10-15 19:45:37

Thank you for your interest in our products. The comments of our consumers are important to our continued success. At this time, we do not specify to our suppliers that we will not use genetically modified ingredients. Most GMO's are in corn and soy products. We use both, so we are unable to guarantee that our products are GMO free.

We posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1blbc6/good_evening_africa_weve_developed_a_new_site_to/) before about our project [Agroam](http://www.agroam.org).

Those were early days for our project, and I'm happy to give an update on what we've been up to and where we see ourselves going in the next few months.

For those that don't know, Agroam works on trying to increase efficiency in the smallhold agricultural market. In Africa in particular, middlemen and wholesalers have a predatory relationship with agriculture. Farmers don't have access to the type of information they need in order to increase their bargaining power, or find new sales channels. We refer to this as ""information cartels"", and Agroam is trying to break them, so that everyone has a fair chance at making a good life from their hard work regardless of their business size.

Last time we had a very simple prototype. It was bleak. A lot of bugs, and nothing much to look at unless you were colorblind to begin with. We've now discovered the power of complimentary colors! 

More than that though, we overhauled a lot of our data-collection algorithms and tools. On our homepage, you'll notice a small box that allows you to check agricultural product prices. We have a much more powerful version of that for those that are registered with our system. The way this tool works is that we've primed it with a lot of data from various sources. We can't stand by the complete accuracy of it, but we think it gives users an order of magnitude of what your product is worth, whether you're in Afghanistan or NYC. The best part is that as more users from different countries start using our system, the more the prices will reflect local averages - so we're very excited that that is up and running.

Finally - we have a **big** announcement of what we've been working on. If you're in South Africa, the homepage might look a bit different to you - asking you to download and print a PDF. This PDF has instructions on how you can send a low cost SMS to Agroam to check market prices, have us send an email to everyone on our system telling them you have something to sell, or give you a few sales leads contact info for people in your industry. We're hopeful that with these tools, a smallhold farmer in a rural area with no internet access should be able to dramatically increase their incomes. We've designed them in such a way so that if a user can top up their phone credit, they should  be able to have the equivalent functionality of a dedicated marketing firm in their pocket.

We're going to keep testing our service in South Africa for a little while (it's where we're based for the moment) and will hopefully begin releasing our SMS platform throughout other countries on the continent.

We know our biggest hole right now is languages - soon we'll drop google translate and offer hardcoded translations for French and Portuguese. 

I'm around all day to discuss our project, any criticism, or anything related to agriculture supply chains in Africa.

Thanks for reading, and thanks for your feedback last time I posted!

He quickly realised the burden of cancer in Africa was much greater than he had thought – accounting for about 700,000 deaths every year – and that very few scientific papers about the disease on the continent were available.

“I realised that cancer is this huge disease in Africa that doesn’t really get much research attention,” he says. “But it’s not just an African problem, it’s global … It stands out as a problem that does not distinguish between geographies or socioeconomic class.”

Fifteen years after his father’s death, Bediako is leading Yemaachi Biotech, a company he co-founded in 2020 in Ghana’s capital, Accra, dedicated to building the largest, and possibly the first, database of genetic and clinical information in Africa from up to 7,500 cancer patients.

Its employees are young, most in their mid- to late-20s, and drawn from across the continent. More than half of the workforce is female.

The African Cancer Atlas will provide insights into cancer in African populations, invaluable for drug discoveries and treatment research, while helping to address disparities in cancer outcomes. It will be available for free to African researchers. Last month, the Swiss pharmaceutical multinational Roche announced it would back the project with funding and technical support.

Steve Biko was born in 1946, in King William’s Town in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. As a medical student at the University of Natal, he was involved with the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS) and went on to found the South African Students’ Association (SASO). At a time when the African National Congress and Pan-Africanist Congress were banned by the government, SASO filled the political vacuum by evolving into the Black Consciousness Movement. 

In 1972 Biko was expelled from the university, and the following year he was banned by the authorities. Despite this, he played a key role in organizing the protests that culminated in the Soweto Uprising of 1976. 

He helped to unite over 70 black consciousness groups which helped to develop the Black Consciousness Movement and help advance the liberation struggle..building a vanguard party. He was banned between 1975 and 1977 and caught, arrested and in police detention September 12, 1977 after being beaten mercilessly, he slipped into a coma to his death!

Although Biko never lived to write his memoirs, he left behind some revealing documents. African Lives includes a portion of an interview Biko gave to an American businessman a few months before he was detained and beaten to death.

He was assassinated because he represented power of Africa Unity and the black consciousness and courage of the people!!!

Gadaa is the indigenous system of governance used by the Oromos in Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Oromo have a very rich culture, fostered by the size of the population and large land areas with diverse climatic conditions. One highly developed self-sufficient system which has influenced every aspect of Oromo life is the Gadaa system. It is a system that organizes the Oromo society into groups or sets (about 7-11) that assume different responsibilities in the society every eight years. It has guided the religious, social, political and economic life of Oromo for many years, and also their philosophy, art, history and method of time-keeping.

The activities and life of each and every member of the society are guided by Gadaa. It is the law of the society, a system by which Oromo administer, defend their territory and rights, maintain and guard their economy and through which all their aspirations are fulfilled.

The Gadaa system has served as the basis of democratic and egalitarian political system. Under it the power to administer the affairs of the nation and the power to make laws belong to the people. Every male member of the society who is of age and of Gadaa grade has full rights to elect and to be elected. All the people have the right to air their views in any public gathering without fear.

There follows a brief description of how the Gadaa system works: there are two well-defined ways of classifying male members of the society, that is the hiriyya (members of an age-set all born within the period of one Gadaa rule of eight years) and Gadaa grade. The Gadaa grades (stages of development through which a Gadaa class passes) differ in number (7-11) and name in different parts of Oromia although the functions are the same. The following are the Gadaa grades:-

1. Dabballee (0-8 years of age)

2. Folle or Gamme Titiqaa (8-16 years of age)

3. Qondaala or Gamme Gurgudaa (16-24 years of age)

4. Kuusa (24-32 years of age)

5. Raaba Doorii (32-40 years of age)

6. Gadaa (40-48 years of age)

7. Yuba I (48-56 years of age)

8. Yuba II (56-64 years of age)

9. Yuba III (64-72 years of age)

10. Gadamojjii (72-80 years of age)

11. Jaarsa (80 and above years of age)

We will briefly describe the duties of a Gadaa class as it passes through the above grades.

The Dabballee are sons of the Gadaa class who are in power, the Luba. They are boys up to 8 years of age. Thus this is a stage of childhood. Upon reaching their eighth year, they enter the Folle grade. At this age they are allowed to go further away from their villages and to perform light work.

At 16 years old, they enter the Qondaala. They may now go long distances to hunt and perform heavy work. Three years before the Qondaala ends, those of the Gadaa class come together and nominate the future group leaders (hayyu council) who eventually will constitute its presidium and thereby the executive, judicial and ritual authorities. The final election is preceded by an often lengthy campaign of negotiations. After nomination, the candidates tour the region accompanied by their supporters to win the backing of the people before election, The individuals will be elected on the basis of wisdom, bravery, health and physical fitness.

In the Kuusa grade, the previously elected leaders are formally installed in office, although they do not yet assume full authority except in their own group. This is one of the most important events in the life of the individual and the Gadaa system over all. In the next grade, Raaba Doorii, members are allowed to marry. This and the Kuusa grade constitute a period of preparation for the assumption of full authority. At the end of this period the class members enter Luba or Gadaa, the most important class of the whole system, attain full status, and take up their position as the ruling Gadaa class. At this stage the system comes to a stop momentarily and all men move to the proceeding class vacating the last class which is the immediately occupied by a new class of youth who thus begin their ascent of the system's ladder.

The former ruling class, the Luba, now becomes Yuba. The Yubas, after passing through three separate eight-year periods, are transferred to the Gadamojjii class. Then they enter the final grade called Jaarsa and retire completely.

As described briefly above, when the Oromo man passes from one stage to the next, his duties and way of life in society change. For instance, during the grades of Qondaala, Kuusa and Raaba Doorii, the individuals learn war tactics , Oromo history, politics, ritual, law and administration over a period of 24 years. When they enter the Gadaa class or Luba at the age of about 40 years, they have already acquired all the necessary knowledge to handle the responsibility of administering the country and the celebration of rituals. It ends with partial retirement of the whole, group of elders to an advisory and judiciary capacity.

The following are the Gadaa officials and their duties according to the Tuullama Gadaa practice:

1. Abbaa Bokku - President

2. Abbaa Bokku - First Vice-President

3. Abbaa Bokku - Second Vice-President

4. Abbaa Chaffe - Chairman of the Assembly (Chaffe)

5. Abbaa Dubbi - Speaker who presents the decision of the presidium to the Assembly

6. Abbaa Seera - Memoriser of the laws and the results of the Assembly's deliberations.

7. Abbaa Alanga - Judge who executes the decision

8. Abbaa Duula - In charge of the army

9. Abbaa Sa'a - In charge of the economy

Thus, the entire presidium consists of nine members, called ""Salgan Yaa'ii Borana"" (nine of the Borana assembly). The Abbaa Bokkus are the chief officials. (Bokku is a wooden or metal scepter, a sign of authority kept by the Abbaa Bokku, the president). The Abbaa Bokkus have counselors and assistants called Hayyus who are delegated from the lower assemblies.

There are three level of assembly - inter-clan, clan and local chaffes, chaffe being the Oromo version of parliament. The chaffe assembly was held in the open air in a meadow under the odaa (sycamore) tree. The chaffe made and declared common laws and was source of the accumulated legal knowledge and customs. In the hierarchy of Gadaa chaffes, the assembly of the entire presidium of the ruling - Gadaa Class - is the highest body whose decision is final. It is the assembly at which representatives of the entire population come together, at predetermined times, to evaluate among other things, the work of those in power. If those in power have failed to accomplish what is expected of them, the assembly has the power to replace them by another group elected from among the same Gadaa class or Luba. And this was one of the methods of checking and balancing political power in the Oromo society. The second highest Gadaa assembly is the clan chaffe. It is from these assemblies that special delegates to the higher assembly are elected. The lowest Gadaa chaffe is the local chaffe. This is made up of local members of the Luba from among whom representatives to clan chaffes are elected.

The holders of these responsible posts can remain in office for eight years only, in normal times, and are then replaced by a new group of officers. The power is handed over at a special ceremony at a special place and time. The office-holders conduct government - political, economic, social, ritual and military - affairs of the entire nation for this period. During war time all capable men fight under the leadership of the group in office. During the eight year period the officials live together in a village (yaa'aa village) and when necessary travel together.

There are five Gadaas in a cycle of 40 years. If a man enters office (becomes Luba) now, his sons will become Luba 40 years from now. The five Gadaa (sometimes called Buttaa) in the cycle have names, which vary slightly from region to region. Among some Oromo communities, the sets of five Gadaa names used by the sons are different from those of the fathers. Whereas among other communities, the same set of Gadaa names are used for both fathers and sons. For instance, the Gadaa practiced in the Borana community uses the following different sets of names for the five Gadaa. (Could be likened to five parties who take power in turns).

Fathers generation Sons generation

1. Birmajii Aldada

2. Melba Horota

3. Muudana Bifoole

4. Roobale Sabaqa

5. Duuloo Kiloolee

In this manner, a given name repeats itself every 80 years. This is in fact the complete Gadaa cycle divided into two semi-cycles of 40 years each. The first 40 years is the Gadaa of the fathers and the second is the Gadaa of the sons.

Although it is not known with any degree of certainty where and when the Gadaa system started, it is known and documented that the Oromo have been practicing it for well over 500 years. However, according to oral Oromo historians, the Gadaa system has been in practice for several centuries. ""Their (Borana Oromo) noted historian, Arero Rammata, was able to recount, in 1969, an oral history covering four thousand years"", (Prouty et al, 1981). Today Gadaa experts easily recall fifty-seven Abbaa Gadaas with important events. Of course, this highly sophisticated system cannot have appeared without having been based on something earlier. Therefore, further study and analysis is required to know more about its origin and development.

Social scientists of diverse backgrounds at different times have studied the Gadaa system. Many of them have testified that it is uniquely democratic. Among those authorities, Plowden (1868), stated, ""among republican systems, Gadaa is superior."" Asmarom Legesse (1973) described the Gadaa system: ""one of the most astonishing and instructive turns the evolution of human society has taken."" Indeed, it is one of the most fascinating sociopolitical structure of Africa that even influenced the lives of other peoples. Several neighboring peoples have practiced a sort of the Gadaa. Among these are Sidama, Walayita, Konso, Darasa, Nyika, Nabdi, Maasai, etc., (Beckingham et al, 1954).

Like living organism, cultures undergo evolution in order to adapt to changing conditions. The Gadaa system has thus been undergoing evolutionary changes since its inception so as to serve better a continually developing society. However, the fundamental that occurred in the Gadaa system, starting around the end of the eighteenth century, were brought about mainly by events set in motion from outside the Oromo society. Therefore, it was not fully a normal or natural development.

In most communities suddenly and in a few cases gradually, the usefulness of the Gadaa system declined. Among the factors that had contributed to this decline were: firstly, the protracted wars that preceded the onset of colonization. The end of the eighteenth century was marked by constant wars and skirmishes, particularly in the north and north-eastern Oromia against the encroachment of the Abyssinians. Because of the insecurity imposed by such wars coupled with the distances involved to go to the Gadaa ceremonies to change the leadership, the Abbaa Duulas (fathers of war) stayed on their post for much longer period than required by the Gadaa rules. This gave these war leaders a mandatory power, because they were forced or encouraged by the society and existing circumstances, such as the continuous wars, to hang on to power. This weakened one of the outstanding features of the Gadaa system, the built-in checks and balances mechanism of political power. This in turn weakened the ideology by which the Oromo nation was successfully led for several centuries.

In addition to the protracted wars, the passing of major trade routes through the area and the subsequent expansion of trade gained the war leaders more wealth. Thus the wealth, fame and power they gradually gained enabled them to command a larger number of followers in the area they were defending. Thus they usurped the political power that belonged to the Gadaa officials and the people and finally some of them declared themselves ""mootii"" (kings).

The second important factor that contributed to this decline was the coming of new beliefs and religions. The politico-religious aggression that took place in the expansion of Islam and Christianity has affected the culture of the Oromo people very much. The invasion of Oromo land by Muslims in the east and south and by Christians in the north have left their mark on the Oromo culture.

Thirdly, the changes in the mode of living of several Oromo communities was probably one of the important factors that led to the decline of Gadaa. As the Oromo society developed, there was a gradual change in the social, economic and political life of the people. For instance, in many parts of Oromia, a settled agrarian mode of life developed fast and the people practiced both mixed agriculture - raised crops and animals - and nomadic pastoralism. The latter was the dominant mode of life before this time, although Oromo have practiced cultivation for a long time and have made significant contribution to agriculture by domesticating plants and rearing rare varieties of crop plants. The introduction and expansion of trade had significant contribution also. These and other related factors led to the emergence of a new social system, which created a significant pressure on the Gadaa system and brought about a modification or change in the Gadaa practices.

Finally, the onset of colonization had tremendously reduced the political and usefulness of Gadaa system as the administrative affairs and management of the national economy were taken over by the colonizers except in remote regions. Atseme noted, ""Menilek outlawed the major chaffe meetings in the Oromo areas he conquered."" Bartels (1983) also noted, ""Gadaa ... was gradually deprived by Amharas of most of its political and judicial powers and reduced to merely ritual institution."" Even the social aspects, that is the ritual and ceremonial aspects, have not been left to the people. The observance of Gadaa ceremonies has been prohibited by proclamation.

The Oromo people also have a rich folklore, oral tradition, music and art. For example, it is believed that the Oromo are responsible for the invention and use of phallic stones (Wainwright, 1949 and Greenfield, 1965). Decorations of stone bowls from Zimbabwe include pictures of cattle with long ""lyre-shaped"" horns such as raised by Oromo. According to these scholars, this and the phallic stones found in Zimbabwe are traced directly to Oromo and linked to their early settlements there and to the Zimbabwe civilization. Wainwright (1949) argued that these were founded by the Oromo. He wrote: ""Waqlimi and his people came from Galla land and its neighborhood, and were already installed in southern Rhodesia before A.D. 900."" (Waqlimi is an Oromo name). This date coincides with the date of the erection of some of the famous buildings there which Wainwright says were built by ""Galla."" This appears to be part of the spread of Cushitic civilization.

He is known for his administrative acumen, military strategies, and contributions to the Deccan region during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Born in Harar, Ethiopia, he was sold into slavery as a child and brought to India, where he rose to prominence through sheer determination and exceptional skills.

Early Life and Rise to Power

Malik Ambar's journey began in Ethiopia, where he was born into a humble family. After being enslaved and brought to India, he was trained in various disciplines, including warfare and administration. His intelligence and leadership qualities earned him freedom and eventually led to his service under the Nizam Shahi rulers of Ahmednagar. He became a trusted advisor and later established himself as the regent of the Ahmednagar Sultanate.

Contributions to Administration

Malik Ambar is best known for his innovative administrative reforms. He introduced a revenue system based on land measurement, which ensured equitable taxation for farmers. This system, known as the Raiyatwari system, laid the foundation for efficient governance in the region. His policies aimed at improving agricultural productivity and ensuring justice for the peasantry.

Military Achievements

A skilled military strategist, Malik Ambar played a crucial role in resisting Mughal expansion into the Deccan. He organized a formidable army and utilized guerrilla warfare tactics to counter the superior Mughal forces. His ability to mobilize troops and adapt strategies made him a thorn in the side of Mughal emperors like Akbar and Jahangir. Malik Ambar's campaigns successfully preserved the independence of Ahmednagar for many years.

Urban Planning and Legacy

Malik Ambar is also credited with shaping urban development in the Deccan. He founded Khadki (later renamed Aurangabad), transforming it into a thriving city with well-planned infrastructure. His vision for urban planning reflected his commitment to creating sustainable and prosperous communities.

Despite facing challenges from powerful adversaries, Malik Ambar's legacy endures as a symbol of resilience and visionary leadership. His contributions to governance, military strategy, and urban development continue to be studied and admired by historians.

Malik Ambar's life exemplifies triumph over adversity. From being enslaved to becoming one of the most influential leaders in Indian history, his story is a testament to perseverance, intellect, and leadership.",[],2025-10-15 19:45:54

* *""This will be a wake-up call for African leaders""* I disagree they are very insulated from this crisis & to begin with a lot of African leaders are very happy with the AID complex ... it works for them, the americans and whomever need someone to collude with locally, they would have done something sooner if this didn't work for them. 
* *""USAID was more about a covert operation""* This sounds like a conspiracy to me, USAID is a way to perpetuate american soft power and influence, they would threaten to cut off a government doesn't fall in line but also provide aid to friendly governments even when those very governments are undemocratic. The actual aid workers, asproblematic as they are (think white saviours to the elite class of continental Africans who find work in these organizations), were not likely to be doing any covert operation.
* ""Trump is looking after his people"" ok let's see how this money is returned to the American people?!
* The GMO / HIV AIDs thing: now I know where she is coming from but this is a massive over simplification and again like a conspiracy theory

The truth is the US & many other global actors who don't have the interest of African's in mind and have very deliberately fostered a reliance on foreign aid in many nations. This has been an intentional polical project. **I agree with her** about USAID being linked to resource extraction and never actually being enough to create change. This isn't how the world should work, I agree. But **cutting off aid on a whim could cost lives.** 

Moreover making the jump from a reliance on aid to the wealth being extracted from Africa actually going back into Africa is sooo complicated even though it has to happen it won't happen over night. There soo much to change in order for this to become a reality and essentialy this is a power move on the part of the USA that disregards people's lives.

* The attack, which occurred from late Friday into Saturday morning, took place in Yelwata, a town in Benue State.
* “Amnesty International has been documenting the alarming [escalation of attacks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/9/gunmen-kill-30-during-vicious-attack-in-southeast-nigeria-rights-group) across Benue state where gunmen have been on a killing spree with utter impunity. These attacks have been causing massive displacement and may affect food security as majority of the victims are farmers.”- Amnesty
* State governor’s office, told the AFP news agency earlier on Saturday that the attack lasted about two hours and a “number of houses were burnt down”.
* He added that government officials and police officials had visited Yelwata and “confirmed” a lower death toll of 45.
* But locals told AFP that they feared that more than 100 people had been killed in the attack.
* Another resident, Christian Msuega, said he escaped the attack, but his sister and brother-in-law had died after being burned alive.
* In the region, attacks are common as local herders, mostly Muslim ethnic Fulani, and farmers, many of whom are Christian, clash over the limited access to land and water.
* Last month, gunmen who were believed to be herders killed at least 20 people in the Gwer West area of Benue.",['food security'],2025-10-15 19:45:59

It is a meeting that aims to resuscitate relations with the black continent, in a context where most African countries have oriented their cooperation towards other partners like China and Russia.

49 African countries in addition to the African Union are expected in Washington today for the US-Africa summit. The first such meeting dates back to 2014, under the presidency of Barack Obama. His successor, Donald Trump, had clearly shown his lack of interest in Africa. Food security, the fight against terrorism, climate change but also democracy and governance are on the summit table. It is a three-day meeting designed to strengthen the relationship between the United States and the African continent, mainly due to the competition from China and Russia, which have become no less important partners for Africa, to the great displeasure of France and the USA. It is therefore a question of the American administration putting Africa back at the heart of world diplomacy.

The US wants to get closer to Africa

It is therefore a catch-up or recovery act that the current American president, Joe Biden, is engaging in. The latter, compared to his predecessor, shows a clear desire to get closer to Africa. According to sources, he supports the idea of a seat for Africa on the UN Security Council and will call at the summit for the African Union to be formally represented at the G20, it was reported. “This decade will be decisive. And the coming years will determine how the world is reordered,” said the National Security Council’s ‘Mr Africa’, Judd Devermont, stressing that the Biden administration “firmly believes that Africa will have a decisive voice”, Afrimag reports.

Confronting the Chinese and Russian presence

This summit takes place in a particular context. Indeed, China and Russia have become, in such a short time, omnipresent partners for Africa. As the largest creditor of poor and developing countries, China is investing massively in the resource-rich African continent. For example, Xi Jinping’s country has already exempted imports from some twenty African countries from customs duties. For its part, Russia has significantly increased its presence there. It is even common, during anti-French demonstrations, for people to wave the Russian flag and encourage their leaders to turn to Vladimir Putin’s country. Moscow has taken advantage of this to send mercenaries and develops close ties with some capitals such as Bamako.

49 out of 54 African countries invited

For this summit, the US administration sent a total of 50 invitations to Africa. Almost all African countries are invited to this meeting, except those with which the African Union does not have good relations, such as Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and Sudan. But it must also be said that two other countries such as Eritrea, with which Washington says it does not have full diplomatic relations, and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic are also absent from the meetings. This is the result of open dialogue. The summit ends on Thursday 15 December with a reception at the White House.

A thing that many farmers I have talked to have mentioned is that, in the first years of RoundupReady(TM), Monsanto was suggesting that weeds would have never developed resistance to glyphosate.

What are the downsides of organic farming of diverse vegetable farming, not just a specialized farming of certain crops? Is it even done?

It just doesn’t seem to be done easily when farming in itself is not an easy field to work in. Especially with larger family farms that grow a large diversity of vegetable/fruit crop, not necessarily just dairy, grain, meat, orchards, etc. where their focus is in one general area. I truly mean medium to large size diverse crop farming, not backyard hobby farming that would be a bit easier to maintain organic practices. The labor costs will be driven up exponentially just to replace what pesticides and insecticides can do on such a grand scale. But the guilt of product use and its environmental impact is also overwhelming in its own way.

If organic farming is not as easily done on a larger scale, what are sustainable practices that a large farming operation can implement? What are resources that are legit to look into to implement more sustainable practices if 100% organic is just not possible? Practices I would love to learn about are composting/how to turn into fields for nutrient rich soil, different synthetic vs. natural pesticides/insecticides (save the pollinators supporter), if organic farming is done with large scale operations that are not specialized…

Recently corteva pulled the dealership from the local grain elevator where I do 99% of my farming business. The local elevator is smaller privately owned and has been a pioneer dealer for 47 years. 

In my humble opinion pioneer corteva is the worst company in agriculture. I want to be clear they have good products but the company culture is awful, greedy, and cut throat imo. I have always kind of known they treated their employees poorly but I have never been treated worse as a customer by any other company. 

I have yet to hear for anyone at pioneer. What do they expect me to do? Do they really not care about my business enough to even call or try and offer me any solution. 

I have never really had any product support from corteva the support always came from the employees at the elevator. So why would corteva  make such a tone deaf decision to remove the dealership and alienate customers and sales people who otherwise would have kept buying and selling seed and chemicals for years to come. 

In conclusion I really hope whoever’s idea it was to pull small local dealerships is removed from their position but in reality they will probably be promoted.",['Corteva'],2025-10-15 19:46:07

I manage a small scale organic farm on Kauai, subtropical zone 12. I also manage the greenhouse, seeding, thinning, etc. My issue lies in the varying quality of the starts week to week. The month of June starts were healthy, big and green. Final week of June starts were notably stunted and yellowed. As of this week they’re just starting to be healthy again. 
I do the same thing every week so I’m surprised to see such vast differences.

I’ll detail out my procedure roughly:
-Sanitize cell trays with bleach water.
-Mix peat moss soilmix (Sunshine #4 SunGro) with Sustane 4-6-4, wet soil.
-Fill cell trays (72 or 128)
-Seed cells, cover with light layer of soil.
-H2O again.

They’re hand watered once to twice daily. I’ve looked into moon calendar and planting associations. I don’t see a correlation so far based on the data I’ve kept…. I guess I’m wondering if this is just usual or not?

But, its not very cheap. So im wondering if anyone knows what the minimum amount that can be added to an acre where it actually will have an effect. I figure a light dusting wont do much.

I just heard it from a friend that organic farming uses more fuel and steel compared to conventional farming, but how come? Is the steel for building greenhouses? I think he meant steel for weed control.

He also said it's common for organic farmers to drive a cultivating tractor around the farm to knock down weeds once a week, but wouldn't that lead to soil erosion? Can the soil (and the disturbed weeds) not be compacted afterwards?

Ive contacted over 30 soybean related suppliers within the US and none of them are interested in doing business with the chinese.

Im under the impression Ive been handed an impossible task? the closest Ive gotten to striking a deal was with a farmer who agreed to send 300k bushels of non gmo soybeans which is honestly just not enough.

does anyone here have any connection to a supplier that has enough non-gmo soybean supply to carry out a deal of this magnitude?

the commission is huge and I have no problems sharing it with someone who points me in the right direction.

Since there is no legally binding, agreed upon definition as to what regen ag is and isn't, opinions seem to be all over the place on if regen is a worthwhile talking point or if it's just greenwashing bullshit.

Pictured is a 3 acre field. We have been working on ridding it of poison ivy and started a fenced in garden. Lots of deer here. Less rabbits, coyotes take care of them.

We are applying for a high tunnel and help with irrigation. 

Planting an orchard in the right back which is the South West part of the field. The view of this picture is facing South.

My husband and I are still working, so we do not have 100% focus on the farm.

We already started Beekeeping and had 25 lbs of honey this year from 4 colonies. (2 swarms) 

We are having the kitchen certified because we found products are going to be more profitable.  Jams, jellies and frozen pizzas. 

We are in a very rural area though May-Nov there are a lot of tourists. About 10k a week passby on the nearby bike trail, 7 miles away. 

We have coyotes, bobcat, hawks.... So our chickens get out though not hugely free roamed. I'd like to build better runs with roofs to protect them.

We have 10 acres of woods besidea this field to play with.

We have a beautiful building to teach classes, though that is what I'm currently talking to attorneys about, we are being told we cannot have events due to the local ordinance. We bought the place 2 years ago and the zoning officer said we could do all that we wanted to do... So now I'm working with what we've got. 

Advice, tips, on what can help us become profitable.

Sometimes, I'd slowly open one and be able to slide off a piece of the shell and it looked like victory was at hand, but then I'd rip the egg and the egg white would be stuck to the shell and my fingernails once again.

I never knew why this happened. I thought I didn't boil it at the right millisecond?

Then as years went on I switched to organic eggs and learned about organic food. Still too, the eggs would always break upon opening.

Then I saw that organic Pasture Raised eggs were a couple of bucks more than organic. I said you know what, I hate the idea of a chicken sitting in the cage all day, I'll spend the money to buy eggs that are from chickens that get to live on fields. I researched Vital Farms to see if they were BS'ing or not and never knew the truth if they were pasture raised or not.

Well, I do now, and here's why:

The egg shortage didn't give me many choices for eggs. So for the first time in years, I bought regular ""organic eggs"". Different brands, maybe 4 or 5 different brands -- all ripped and had thin shells and were watery.

The problem returned: I can barely open them. Even the organic ones. They keep ripping.

I also instantly noticed that the eggs were watery if I did decide to put some on a pan. The watery egg would just slide right now (unlike the pasture raised eggs which would take time to ooze out like goo -- I'd have to shake the egg to get it all out and even then some was stuck to the shell).

So for weeks, this is what I've been dealing with.

It turns out even ""organic"" eggs can be labeled organic, but the chicken can be malnourished.

Here's why:

Pasture raised chickens get to forage out on grass and eat insects. They get the calcium they need to make eggs the way they are supposed to be in nature.

Chickens that don't see any sunlight, are pumped with hormones, sit in a cage all day dropping eggs at a rapid rate produce more flimsy eggs.

Some day I hope to get my own coop and grow my own chickens and treat them with the respect they deserve.

The pasture raised eggs came back this past week. I've been able to open the eggs with easy again.

Anyway, just posting this because I never knew there was a difference between pasture raised vs ""regular"" caged eggs -- but after this egg shortage, I see it is true.",[],2025-10-15 19:46:09

Anaerobic fermentation is the key concept that i am working with, and contracting farmers to grow high biomass cover crops for the source of plant material. This plant material will be harvested with a forage harvester like you would with silage, the material will then be brought to a very large tank (think city water tanks) to be mixed with water/rotting straw and left to ferment for at least 4 months. The straw that is used will be left near a forest for 2 years before being used, that way it is inoculated with a diverse range of microorganisms. 

Farmers can then come and fill up their tanks from this large communal fertilizer tank and use in their feilds. This liquid fertilizer will be tested regularly to ensure proper application rates which could range from 1:20 to 1:250 depending on final concentration and specific crop needs. This idea could be taken a step further by creating crop-specific batches such as fermented corn silage to be used on feilds of corn.

There will be a fee associated with using the fertilizer and that will be used to cover operational costs and to pay the contracted farmer.

I run an organic mixed vegetable farm and use this method as the standalone liquid fertilizer for the operation. It has shown great results with mixed vegetables. 

Looking for feedback regarding this idea for use in large scale cash cropping becuase i dont have experience in that area. Any concerns, tips, feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",[],2025-10-15 19:46:09

My gripe is, Michelob ran a nice “feel-good” commercial during the Super Bowl tonight, and stated that for every 6-pack of Pure Gold sold, they would help convert 6 square feet of farmland to organic.

As we all know, 43,560sqft in an acre, so divide by 6, and we get 7,260. They’ll have to sell 7,260 6-packs just to convert one acre. I don’t think the average American knows how insignificant Michelob’s promise is. If they sell one million 6-packs, they’ll convert about 140 acres. Big whoop.",[],2025-10-15 19:46:09

*Glacier FarmMedia*—Agriculture Canada says consultations on its [Sustainable Agriculture Strategy](https://www.producer.com/opinion/sustainable-agriculture-strategy-needs-farm-input/) will continue even after six major organizations withdrew from the advisory committee last week.

However, with the federal government in disarray after the Dec. 16 [surprise resignation of former finance minister and deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland](https://www.agcanada.com/daily/finance-minister-freeland-quits-after-clash-with-trudeau), the strategy may never see the light of day.

Pundits suggested her resignation, along with several others in recent weeks, indicates non-confidence in prime minister Justin Trudeau, and an election could come sooner rather than later.

Trudeau had not spoken publicly at time of writing.

Freeland resigned just hours before she was to deliver the fall economic statement and days after she said Trudeau asked her to leave finance for another portfolio.

The statement was to be tabled later Dec. 16, but without a speech from the finance minister.

In it, farmers were looking for possible announcements on extended interswitching and capital gains measures.

In the meantime, the Canadian Canola Growers Association, Canola Council of Canada, Cereals Canada, Grain Growers of Canada, Pulse Canada and Soy Canada issued a statement Dec. 16 regarding their concerns about the strategy.

They said Canadian agriculture is already the most sustainable in the world, and the strategy must contain measures that are practical, science-based, market driven and beneficial for the entire sector as well as the environment.

“Together, we have consistently voiced that there is a lack of industry alignment regarding the targets and actions proposed in the SAS. As a result, we have collectively decided to step back from the advisory committee, as the strategy’s direction does not fully represent the interests of our members,” they said.

The organizations also said they would continue to work with the government on market access, research, innovation and supply chain resiliency.

None would comment further.

Annie Cullinan, spokesperson for agriculture minister Lawrence MacAulay, said farmers are facing many climate threats, and customers are looking for quality, sustainable products. She said the six organizations said they will not participate in the strategy at large, not just the advisory committee.

“It’s deeply disappointing that these organizations have chosen to step away from this important initiative,” she said. “Every opportunity was taken by minister MacAulay to ensure the voices of grain and oilseed farmers would be heard loud and clear in the strategy. We will continue to work hand in hand with farm groups who believe in the importance of improving environmental sustainability in Canadian agriculture.”

The strategy is supposed to be a roadmap to balance environmental sustainability, profitability and competitiveness, but consultations began two years ago and the plan hasn’t yet been released.

Also Dec. 16, Canada’s premiers met in Ontario to discuss the country’s approach to the [25 per cent tariffs](https://www.agcanada.com/daily/trump-discussed-border-trade-with-trudeau-after-pledging-steep-tariffs) that U.S. president-elect Donald Trump says he will impose on Canadian goods as soon as he is in office.

The premiers said they are concerned that Freeland’s resignation leaves a hole in the negotiating team.

Alberta premier Danielle Smith said Canadians should go to the polls. She said a prime minister with a four-year mandate would have more clout in the negotiations.

Parliament was set to rise for the holiday break on Dec. 17 and return Jan. 27.Organizations say they will no longer participate in strategy discussions, saying it does not align with producers' needs

Cobra use to be a good choice, but its not very effective anymore. So we are considering making the switch. In addition to weed control issues, we've had issues with our buyers as well. We're just not sure it's worth the extra work anymore. Anyone have recommendations on what to do from here?",['GMO'],2025-10-15 19:46:12

While we were on the other end, packing and loading for the move, the farmer that had previously farmed this land for many years (lease/agreement with the previous owner) plowed, fertilized and planted soybeans in the field. I only learned this because I was able to intercept a tractor in my hay field (a different field) who was fertilizing it, also for their own use. Through discussion afterward, I was told that one partner did not inform another partner that we are the new owners, even though he provided us a signed letter stating all previous arrangements with the ex-owner were cancelled due to the purchase.

Basically, Farmer/Partner A is old and forgetful and did not tell Farmer/Partner B that the previous agreement with the ex-owners was cancelled.

My plan was to immediately begin working on fencing both fields and converting them to livestock pasture. They existing hay field was to be for sheep and the one with soybean was for cattle.

The farmer is open to making some sort of deal to allow them to harvest. They have access to equipment and potentially breeding stock for sheep and cattle.

I would like to hear some thoughts about the situation. What impact is this likely to have on my soil? Harvest would be late October, and I was hoping to have some forage seeded this fall.

I'm studying sustainable agriculture, and while I appreciate the knowledge I'm getting, I can't help but notice that in this ""scene"", many people seem hostile not only to conventional farming methods, which I understand, but by extension, hostile to conventional farmers. This strikes me as being kind of ridiculous, especially because many of these folks just go off and start homesteads all the while saying organic/permaculture/biodynamic is the future or agriculture.


So what I'm asking is, how many of you conventional farmers would give thought to implementing more sustainable practices on your farms? Things that ""scale up"", so to speak, from small-scale permaculture. Obviously it would be completely unrealistic to think that a farmer with 500 acres is going to build swales and hugulkulture beds, but something like keyline ripping is totally doable on a large scale. Or silvopasture, or perennials that fulfill the same role as certain staple crops like hazelnuts and chestnuts in place of corn or soy. I don't know if any of you have heard of Mark Shepherd and New Forest Farms, but I'm more or less talking about his approach; people can grow most of their annual veg in small scale permaculture or organics, but most of those approaches don't factor in staple crops. So how can staple crops be produced more sustainably by larger farms?


I guess I'm just wondering what the general mindset is towards this stuff. Are these practices things that you guys would like to do in an ideal world but don't have the means to right now, or is it more like you generally just disagree with it outright? If there were more people out there who were doing large-scale sustainable farming, would that potentially make any of you interested? I've talked to some people from a group called the Savanna Institute here in the Midwest which helps large scale farmers implement more sustainable practices that are still compatible with large scale farming, so I guess there's at least some interest in it, but I thought I'd ask reddit too.","['sustainable agriculture', 'agroecology']",2025-10-15 19:46:14

I grew up in the country, we had horses, not crops. When I was growing up I had never even heard of Monsanto. Eventually that changed once I became more interested in food, nature, ecology and human intervention. 
In my research I've found that Monsanto has sued farmers who have not bought Monsanto seed but have a vogue Monsanto crop in their fields due to any number of factors. I have also read about cross contamination, and because Monsanto owns the gene, when cross pollination occurs Monsanto technically would own that plant. Not to mention that randomly inserting a gene creates a plant more susceptible to mutations. 
What are farmer's opinions on Monsanto? Do people still end up getting sued nowadays? How does Monsanto effect you and what can farming communities do (if anything needs to be done) to remain independent. ",['Monsanto'],2025-10-15 19:46:14

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/02/06/were-having-the-wrong-argument-about-gmos/?tid=sm_fb&utm_term=.fc4f80cff587


The reason this is dumb argument is that

1.  It is wishing for a time that cannot exist again without MAJOR population reductions, reallocating large amounts of labor back to the farm and world-wide food insecurity OR forcing everyone to be vegetarian.

2.  Without these changes in #1, a reduction in modern industrialized agriculture will result in a lot more land being used, inefficiently with inefficient pesticides.

3.  This is all a moot point, the genie is out of the bag.

Basically, the author, like countless before him, is arguing for a return to 19th century substance farming where we only had a billion to feed and 90% of them worked hard labor on the farm.

When people come up with this fantasy I ask them which billions they would subject to starvation and who would they send to work on farms?

It is the fantasy of a person who is far removed from food production.

He then thought that industrial agriculture would be 20% more efficient if a similar rule was applied to corn farming when crops were laid out. (For reference, he is talking about this sort of pattern: http://poj.org/images/3766_2.gif). So I ask you reddit, would this hexagon pattern for corn really change the industry forever? 

EDIT: After talking to my friend this morning, I have asked him to clarify and he has come through. The basic concept on that picture I linked would be that corn is planted on every point of the hexagon shape so that rows would be formed. So, instead of straight parallel lines filled with corn they would be staggered so that the corn rows would take on the hexagon shape. I think he was a bit surprised with the first commenters picture that details that exactly (For reference: http://www.nzdl.org/gsdl/collect/cdl/archives/HASH0172/7bf7ecc3.dir/p017c.gif) but nonetheless he still thinks it might not have been applied on an industrial scale or to corn farming...help this guy out reddit :)

I’ve spent about 7 years in quality management of food manufacturing.

I don’t think I’m exactly cut out for the R&D side of things in the food world although I have enjoyed working adjacent with them on projects. 

In reading job descriptions, it seems like there’s some fundamental similarities between the industries like with FDA, cGMPs, ISO, quality systems, but a different side of the coin with the product type and regulation. Is it really that similar to food to be able to learn with only a background in food and food science up to this point? Feels like it would be a little overkill to try to do a Master’s or further education just to move to what seems like a fairly adjacent field/industry.

I'm finishing up my PhD in Food Science this summer. For background, I went straight from earning my B.S. in Chemistry into a Master’s in Food Science, then rolled straight into the PhD program—so I’ve had no industry experience until recently.

About a year ago, my advisor began prioritizing other students, and I was left running the lab, managing research projects, and mentoring newer students academically. It got to the point where I decided to start applying for jobs. I landed an interview at a major CPG company for an R&D scientist contractor role. Unbeknownst to me, the hiring manager was a close friend of my advisor, and they called my advisor behind the scenes (I hadn't listed them as a reference), which blew my cover. Ironically, that seemed to make my advisor finally start paying attention and push me toward graduating on time.

I’ve now been at this big CPG company for 7 months. I’ve had great performance—bringing in internal testing capabilities projected to save the company millions annually. Despite that, I’m still a contractor, and while I survived recent layoffs, the company isn’t doing well financially.

Recently, they opened up several Associate Scientist roles in my department. Although the title says “Associate,” the job responsibilities are equivalent to Scientist—HR downgraded the title due to FTE limits. Oddly enough, while I'm being offered this downgraded Associate role, technicians in the same department are being promoted to “Associate Scientist” titles but will remain in technician-level roles. For context, this company typically offers PhDs a Scientist or Senior Scientist position. HR admitted I’m overqualified but said I can still get the Associate role—just with a starting salary and no eligibility for promotion for 2–3 years.

So, I started applying externally. I got an interview and then an offer from another major CPG company nearby. Originally, I interviewed for a **Scientist** role with a $95K salary and 5% bonus. However, HR called and said I’m “severely underqualified” for the Scientist title but they still want to offer me the job—as an **Associate Scientist** at $75K. I pushed back, saying I don’t believe I’m underqualified and asked for $80K. They responded that even $80K was too high. I’m confused because this is the same role I was interviewed for with the same responsibilities and originally offered $95K.

I can’t tell if I’m being lowballed, or if this is just how things are right now due to the economy. I know other fresh PhDs who walked into Senior Scientist roles right out of grad school. I have strong analytical experience (GC, HPLC, method development, etc.) and have delivered measurable impact at my current job.

Is anyone else going through something similar? Am I missing something here? Would love to hear other perspectives—especially from folks in food science, chemistry, or related CPG roles.",[],2025-10-15 19:46:22

* PR situation
* Lifestyle & cost of living

Now I'm not sure if this  path is for me. I don't mind an extra 30 mins a day, but 15 hours of overtime plus some weekends sounds pretty intense. I would love to hear from QA food people about their experiences. ",[],2025-10-15 19:46:22

I’m interested in pursuing food science as a possible career and in need of a few pointers.

For some background information. I’m currently a third year studying Cognitive Science and as much as I love my major I’m planning on taking a gap year to consider my options which includes taking a jab at food science. My school has a food science minor however its coursework consists of a more environmental, sustainable approach which doesn’t really suite my interests of wanting to do quality assurance and product development. After this school year is over I plan on completing a certificate for biotech at my local community which I hope increases my likelihood of getting an internship at a food company. 

Does anyone have any advice or pointers as to what kinds of activities, certificates, or even volunteer work I should get involved in?

I appreciate everyone’s responses :)",[],2025-10-15 19:46:22

**Ingredients** \- whey protein, dates, whey crisp, acacia gum, banana, peanuts, almonds, coconut oil, rosemary extract, oats, salt, cinnamon powder, peanut butter

**Problem -**

The main problem is the taste it's deteriorating within 2 weeks when stored at room temperature packed in aluminum foil and kept in an airtight jar.

(People who I have given to taste only had a positive opinion on the first few days after preparing the bar)

I am a biotech graduate so I don’t have a deep understanding of food science, I have gone through multiple research papers and recipes but nothing seems to work.

Do I need less moisture or more in the bar ??

I am yet to check for water activity.

Hii I am posting on this sub looking for some advice from anyone who has gone through this similar process of choosing which university to go to. I have just graduated highschool and while I haven’t had any formal exposure to foodscience I enjoy both biotech and food industries and see myself possibly dedicating my future yo such areas. (Specially when it comes to R&D, I was also looking for minoring in some sort of business/finance field to complement)

However, the issue of starting from zero and without guidance is the uncertainty. I understand foodscience is a field of many disciplines but I worry some of the majors I applied to would make it hard to make my way into it. I anyone wants to give their opinion on the options I have to study I would be so grateful :)

Thank you!       Options are:

UCLA molecular, celular and developmental biology (my parent’s liking due to quality of living)

Berkeley genetics and plant biology

UC Davis Biotechnology 

UIUC plant biotechnology

WashU Molecular Biology and Biochem

Professor David Block is leading the way on this initiative, and UC Davis is a prime spot to get into the Silicon Valley venture capital action as one of the few food science programs near the Bay Area.

Many startups in the cultivated meat and cellular agriculture space have made their home in good ol’ San Francisco and the surrounding tech centers.

The program is currently funded by a $3.55 million grant from the National Science Foundation.

I'm now seriously hating my job and need to make moves towards a change even if it's inconvenient and scary.

I have a PhD in Analytical Chemistry and 4 years experience in the Pharma industry doing Analytical Development (an R&D department). The work is occasionally challenging but not in ways that I find stimulating. I do not care at all about the industry or the product; I find drug development uninteresting. I also want to work more in product development and research (what I do now is glorified quality control and regulatory).

Food is something I actively find interesting and is something I nerd out on all the time (which I never do with biotech). However, I have no idea where to start in terms of learning about the various R&D roles available and what I need to do in order to get my foot in the door. I got some generous advice from an IFS spokesperson I connected with but I'm growing increasingly wary of the IFS cert that was recommended and looking for more opinions. IFT also has other resources but are all behind expensive paywalls, which automatically puts me on guard.

Specifically here are are my questions:

* Where can I learn about the various aspects and steps of food science/tech R&D?
   * What is the typical R&D life cycle of a food product?
* As a PhD with somewhat relevant experience in a related industry, what would I need to get my first food science job? A certification? Another graduate degree?
* How do I build a network when I have no connections in the food industry? I was planning on attending conferences, but that's out of the question at the moment.",[],2025-10-15 19:46:22

Of course I am fully aware I can work under food safety, quality assurance, product development and nutrition (basically the food industry, biotech industry).

I also took some food tech units in my degree so I know a bit about it. Anyway, I'm just really curious about this.

Obviously in certain cases you will have inherent properties of a food that make it taste the way it tastes (e.g. a compound that both stimulates the tastebuds and drives another process in the food, such as an Lemon's flavour and it being sour), and I understand as well that physical texture is a big part of taste too, and that certain genetic pathways are intertwined, 

However, in many cases flavour is dictated by specific compounds produced from the food. Is it not possible for specific cases to just genetically engineer these compound production into a new fruit or whatever. Say, make a banana that has had all the flavour metabolic pathways punched out and replaced with the metabolic pathways that produce the strawberry flavour?",[],2025-10-15 19:46:22

As a little background, I got an undergraduate in Biotech. I got solid bases on biochem and microbiology along with molecular biology techniques. I got no industry experience (yeah, I know) but worked as a lab teacher for a year. (This might be relevant in atleast showing I could get and keep a job.)

Some things I'm doing/got done during my first MSc year:
* My thesis is on developing a functional bread.
* Got plenty of experience in food analyzes techniques.
* Got an accepted paper and another manuscript under review.
* Attended full semester courses on Food Chemistry, Food Tech, Sensorial Evaluation, Statistics, among others.
* In November will attend a congress with high industry attendance in order to network like crazy, as well as presenting some results.
*Attended several workshops in meat and dairy food production on a lab scale.
*Learning R programming at the moment.

To cut a long story short, I'm originally from Madrid, and I'm trying to find a job in Spain in the food science industry. I studied chemistry and biochemistry in the US, got a PhD in protein biophysics in the UK, and I'm currently a research associate at a world-class institution (also in the UK). I have no regulated experience in the food industry, but I'm a huge nerd about it and have read plenty of books on it and practiced at home (I commandeered an old immersion circulator and other equipment from lab). Plus from my degrees I have pleeenty of experience with the instrumentation and things like protein denaturation and whatnot.

You would think that with these credentials it wouldn't be so incredibly hard to at least get an interview, but I have had no luck whatsoever. I have attempted to contact the Basque Culinary Center repeatedly but nothing has panned out.
I have exhausted all the contacts I have in these field, and have nothing to show for it. I really, really like it, but it seems impossible to get a job on it unless I move to the US or northern Europe. Do you guys have any clues on what to try next? I really don't want to have to settle for a job in the pharma/biotech industry.

I would much rather end up in Madrid, but I'm open to France or Italy, I really don't think I can stay away from southern europe after 9 years abroad...

I have recently stepped off the ""organic"" food craze and have decided to just eat conventionally. Growing up I always ate convential fruit and vegetables or local ones without any issues back home in Beirut. However ever since coming to the West people here are obsessed with organic foods and I don't think it's warranted considering all the research about how safe conventional produce is.

That being said, I still have no clue why ginger is more yellow and more potent when organic and am looking for a true, scientific explanation to ease my paranoia. I can also say the same about garlic and even celery. 

Much stronger in flavor when organic. And apples also don't have a soapy taste when organic. Those are pretty much the only foods where I have actually noticed a difference.

Sometimes organic veggies taste bad and sour whereas other times they taste better.

Is this all really due to variety, freshness, or storage? Or is there a deeper reason for this?

Would appreciate any advice from someone with a background in chemistry, food science or even agriculture.

Thanks!",[],2025-10-15 19:46:25

I extracted Urease enzyme from soybeans by soaking and blending soybeans in distilled water and filtering through coffee filters. The liquid was still cloudy and I wanted to clear it up further. I am a chem noob, and had a theory I could mix in some NaHCO3 baking soda to precipitate out son ions because I know many ionic compounds with carbonate are not soluble, leaving soluble urease in the supernatant, which I could decant. I was surprised to see how well this actually worked, but now I am not sure if it worked for the reasons I thought it might. Why did the addition of baking soda cause all the organic soybean matter to settle? (Left is with baking soda, right is without)   
  
Some of the theories I got in r/chemistry are:  
1. increase of pH from baking soda caused the emulsion to break forcing the organic particles to settle  
2. increase of pH made some things insoluble that were soluble at lower pH  
3. [salting out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salting_out) with the NaHCO3 caused  proteins to precipitate out due to high ionic strength of the solution

One of the companies I'm advising, [Sun Bear Bioworks](https://www.sunbearbioworks.com/), is working on an alternative to palm oil produced using precision fermentation in yeast.

They are interested in finding partners to collaborate together in order to test samples of their first palm oil product in various food applications.

Here is a blurb from their team:

""Our goal is to produce an alternative to palm oil, which is well suited to the plant-based meat alternative sector. We are using a well-known yeast strain, which has been used in human consumables before, though ours will have undergone gene-editing. Using precision fermentation, our goal is to be able to use crop residue as a feedstock for the yeast, which naturally produces the oil within their cell walls.

With the lab research we are carrying out we plan to be able to produce the oil extracellularly, which will make the oil a non-GMO, provided we can carry out the processing in a way that removes all yeast cells and DNA. The makeup of the end product most closely resembles RBD palm oil and we believe this will be an ideal product for adding a fatty element to plant-based meat alternatives.

We are aiming for samples to be ready for testing in the first quarter of 2023.

With the known issue of a missing, quality replacement of coconut oil, we are seeking partners who are interested in collaborating on trials with our new oil to validate its suitability in their plant-based meat alternatives.

Are you interested in receiving samples and working with us on testing this new ingredient?""

While I, naturally, am interested in the food chemistry side of things I was wondering how ""involved"" flavor chemistry research could go into organic synthesis or simply natural product chemistry and formulation, if at all.

Many of the research papers I found seemed focused on analytical techniques, such as measuring the volatile compounds coming of various foods (seems big in wine research) or the development of compounds as food aged, etc...

Most of the ""synthesis"" work was related to polymer synthesis for applications in things such as food packaging or coatings.

I am a professional coffee roaster, have posted this with zero success in r/roasting and r/coffee , perhaps someone here might have interesting info for me.

With age of green coffee (washed processed coffee in particular), do all forms of organic acids degrade at a similar rate? or do some degrade faster than others, i.e.. phosphoric acid dropping out of a (green) coffee at a faster rate than quinic, lactic, citric, malic, acetic

I have reasonable knowledge of how roast and roast degree impacts organic acid concentrations in roasted coffee, but I'm always happy to read more info on the subject.

If anyone else has a good idea for other subs to repost in, please let me know!

Many thanks!

We use the wet/pumped curing process. We have a 'normal' brine supplier that makes the mix (Salt, Sugar, Brown Sugar, Nitrites) that we use as a cure-all. Basically, we take a 50lb box of brine mix, dump it into a 40 gallon barrel, add water, stir/let sit, and then pump brine our hams. Our HACCP program says to 12% of green weight, but depending on the ham itself it varies greatly. We do pigs of all sorts of weight/fat content and they all take the brine differently. Then we take it all, put it in tubs, and use the same brine as a cover pickle.

I've basically invented a brine mix that mimics our supplier's. 40 lbs of salt, 10 pounds of sugars (I want to go with all brown sugar if possible), which I have no problems sourcing.
The problem lies in the nitrites. Obviously, we need the nitrites there, but because of organic labeling we can't officially use nitrites. We need to source that from organic compounds if possible.
The easiest route to an end is to use ""Veg Stable 504"" in our brine. It is a refined source of celery extract powder that contains a solid amount of pre-converted nitrites. It can also be labeled Organic.
(Of course, as we all know, this is fucking ludicrous, but it is what it is.)

Basically, My simple, yet too complex to get a straight answer from suppliers is, How much Veg Stable to use in a brine mix to get a proficient brine? I've seen multiple formulas that are way too complex to be of use. I'm not a mathematician, nor am I a chemist.

However, I find it really challenging to apply my sensory perception during evaluation. For example:

* I can’t always tell which samples are closest to the market product
* Struggle to identify which sample has a higher or lower dosage compared to another one
* Often fail to recognize specific flavors (berry, coffee, nut, vanilla, fruit, etc.)
* Unlike the senior R&D staff, I can’t easily distinguish the first taste, middle notes, and aftertaste with just a few drops

The average salary for what my current duties entail sit between 105k-140k probably depend on the company and experience, however i am currently receiving substantially less and it is no where near competitive.

Like my title says I am struggling to keep up with my prep classes for the food science major. 

I had a long journey of trying to choose a major and switched many times before landing on food science. I graduated high school in 2020 and went to community college right after initially I was in marketing but wasn’t doing good in economics so I changed to education since I was working at a school and had a ‘I’ll just do this’ attitude and needed to decide on a major. Found out I didn’t like that and after getting my associates I didn’t transfer. 

I found out about food science around my third year of cc from a show I was watching. I was very intrigued and surprised that it was an option. I have always loved food and the process that went into preparing it, not only cooking but things like brewing, fermentation, and growing. I watched so many ‘how it’s made’ videos when I was younger too lol. 

I never considered a STEM career out of high school bc bluntly I did not have the best grades in math and I did not do well. I felt like I was too dumb to even consider it or do research into the STEM careers. I also had never taken chemistry because I went to a rural high school where they only offered Ag science classes which honestly no one really learned since FFA was their main thing. 

So after going back and forth and deciding I didn’t want to teach just yet I decided to switch to food science. Talked to my advisor we made a plan and it went okay the first two semesters. I was on track to do gen chem 2 and social/life science calc. 

When it was time for those classes my chem prof was switched to a different one who was notoriously known to be terrible and then my calc prof took a leave of absence so both of the classes I had scheduled were ruined for me. Gen chem prof was terrible and withdrew while in calc the dean decided to put two prof in charge of the 16 week course and split into two which ended horribly and a lot of people withdrew. 

In the end I completed no classes in fall 24. Now spring 25 I took chem again and this time regular calc 1 since they didn’t have many prof in the other one. I passed chem but withdrew from calc 1 since I was struggling with many factors outside of class. 

So now I’m taking calc 1 again fall 25 and a day before semester began I got an email from the dean who stated our calc prof will no longer teach the class and we have another prof taking over the class. It was the same prof who took care of my calc class in fall 24. 

I was frustrated because I already know how he taught and I told the dean of the math dept that in past experience the sub had not had the canvas up until the end of the semester so I told him to try to check in on the class to avoid this or with me at least. 

The dean said they would check in about second/third week but he did not until I reached out to him again by the end of the fourth and really told him how he had not been truthful to his words. 

So now the canvas is up on the fifth week the prof had only send to email for our hw and practice sheets. So I’m struggling all over again. I keep failing calc and it has set me so far back that I don’t even have motivation to continue this major especially since there are no transferable food science classes offered at my college. 

I feel again too stupid for this degree even though I really thought I found the major that resonated the most with me. When I learn about food science I get excited, it feeds my curiosity and I want to continue but this calc class has set me back so much and I still have to take organic chem. My confidence has taken a bad hit and I feel too stupid for that too. 

I’m guessing this really might not be the major for me but the thought of changing it makes me feel even worse. I’m 23 so I’ve been in cc for awhile and I should already have a bachelors but I don’t. 

Everyone is moving on and I can’t even get a degree. I’m thinking of dropping out completely but I know I’ll regret that too.

My reason for posting on r/Food Science is that I need a credible source to support the science end of the concept. 

I am an Industrial design student at university. Currently, I am working on a design project that envisions the future of 3D printing food in the home kitchen.

I am proposing that in 2030-2035, a food printer will be a popular appliance to own in the kitchen at home, similar to today's microwave. My task is to design the look of the printer and the food this printer produces. This requires me to know the food's material state before printing.

&#x200B;

**Here is where I need your help.** 

I am proposing that the user fills the food printer with a range of cartridges containing different elements that make up the structure of the food. Each cartridge would contain a stock of either a molecule or flavour compound, which would be added accordingly to replicate the sensations of a particular food. These elements are extruded into a gelatin-like binding mixture used to hold the ingredients together and provide a substance to eat.

In context, the food printer would produce a beef burger patty by extruding the binder mixture, forming the shape of the patty. During the shaping process, the food printer adds the necessary molecules and flavour compounds required to achieve the taste and nutrition of the beef burger patty.

&#x200B;

**My question to you all.**

In theory, would it be possible to create food in this method?

&#x200B;

I appreciate this might be a confusing post. I am happy to answer any questions and welcome any response. I appreciate any help you can provide.",[],2025-10-15 19:46:27

I hear a lot of generalities in terms of problems he talks about, but less so about specific actions he might take.

As one example: he claims glyphosate is bad, but I don't know what specific steps he would actually take to change current practices. Has he indicated that he would ban glyphosate outright? If so, how feasible do we think this would be given the legal/political framework in the united states? Same question for subsidies, food additives, etc.

I have started a draft below summarizing what his potential impacts could be. I would be very curious to hear feedback / suggestions / input from this group. Most importantly, I'm looking for:

1. specific actions he has indicated he might take
2. how feasible are these actions, and
3. how long would it take to implement these actions?

Again, I don't want to make this political, but strictly as a thought exercise so that we may better anticipate changes that may be coming.

Thanks in advance!

Also, before we dive in…might i suggest a rule we all try to follow to keep discourse polite:

Rule #1: Refrain from inserting personal opinions wherever possible, try to stick with objective observations only.

# RFK Jr’s potential impact on the food industry

**Food Ingredients**

•Potential ban / restrictions on certain ingredients

*−Potential targets include BHA, BHT, certain artificial dyes (e.g. Tartrazine), potassium bromate & others*

**Agricultural Practices**

•Potential restrictions or bans on certain herbicides & pesticides (e.g. glyphosate)

•Incentives for regenerative farming and smaller independent farms

*−Reduction in high cost of compliance that favors large corporate agriculture with large economies of scale*

*−Increased scrutiny on industrial waste*

•Increased restrictions on GMO practices \[looking for more specific examples here\]

**Nutrition**

•Overhaul of federal nutrition guidelines

•Limitations on use of SNAP for ultra-processed foods

*−Financial impact could be large (e.g. \~20%+ of Coca Cola’s revenue comes from SNAP purchases)*

•Changes to school lunches and other public food programs to eliminate ultra-processed foods

**Regulatory Agencies**

•Reform, reduce and / or eliminate subsidy programs (targets could include corn, soybeans, wheat, etc)

*−This could lead to higher costs for common ingredients in processed foods including industrial seed oils and high fructose corn syrup*

•Reduce potential conflicts of interest

*−Address “revolving door” between regulators and industry (this could include longer cooling-off periods before regulators can work in industries they once oversaw and vice versa)*

*−Reduced indirect regulatory agency funding from industry via associated non-profits (e.g. Reagan-Udall Foundation)*

•Increased legal scrutiny of industry-funded scientific journals and re-direction of NIH funds towards additional nutritional research

I know that when I search on about how after 2 hours you should discard certin foods (and any type too) that there’s also awareness that people long time ago didn’t have refrigerators and didn’t keep their food in today’s cold fridges for more lasting storage. Did those people too keep rice out for days or did they eat it as they made enough for dinner or supper that there wasn’t any need to worry the way we have to. 

And then another thought is that the food made nowadays are more fragile then the food back then because of how it’s being made, unatrul, too quick, GMO’d, so.. that’s why a high authority called everyone that food left out for more then 2 hours gotta be gone by then.

As the title says, I botched the Alfredo sauce and would like to know what I did wrong.  I will try to keep it short and germane.  I started with 1/3 C fat from a roasted chicken (more on the chicken later), butter and garlic.  It was too much to really saute garlic but my wife was out of town and I needed to feed junior.  I added a third cup of white wine, because, ...that is what I do.  I let that cook down a bit on medium high.  I then added 1/2 C of half and half with a cup of whole milk.  There was no heavy cream to be found.  Once that warmed up and thickened slightly, I pulled out the bag of frozen romano parmigiano measured up an over flowing cup and then slowed added and let it melt into the cream a bit at a time.  The sauce looked good.  It was creamy..

Back to the chicken, it was roasted and the cold snap of the last week has frozen everything in the refridgerator in the garage.  Meh.  I carve out the one breast from the genetically modified frankenstein chicken which would feed two people and put the rest back.  I thawed just enough to dice, so it is half frozen and need to get heated for the dish.

Here is where it all went south.  As soon as the icy cold chicken hit the sauce, all the fat from the milk and cheese got sucked up by the meat.  I was left with chicken and some pale yellow liquid.  My kid is an adventerous eater and he doesn't hold back in his reviews.  He reminded me the escargot with huitlecoche, heavy cream with pasta was better.

And, I forgot the egg yolk in the alfredo sauce, so the sins were more than the alfredo could endure.

So what was it that sucked up all the creaminess of the sauce?  Was it the temperature of the meat, slightly frozen?  Was it the fact that it was meat?  Was it the dilution of butter with wine or the chicken fat?

I can't give a recipe because I typically have a hard time following directions so I wing it.  But I will point out....no flour.  Which I did suspiciously consider at the start.  FWIW, the flavor was great but it wasn't an Alfredo sauce.  And I did finish it for lunch the next day in shame.

I have made up my mind though - I should continue going my own way without listening to this advice. I don't have any known dietary allergies or diseases and none of the mentioned food categories make me feel sick in any way (except sugar. Sugar sucks). I initially thought it was not useful to add them, but there are more stuff to those infographics that I will link , which also adds sugar. And for your information, like many suspected, NONE of them had any citations or resources linked. [More of the infographic](https://imgur.com/a/PgKeTqZ)",[],2025-10-15 19:46:27

In a Masters program currently and took a Fermented Food products elective that just finished up. One of the products discussed was fermented meats and the differences in the US vs the world(or Europe?). The US uses nitrite and LAB. Overseas they use Nitrate and LAB+ Micrococcaceae/coagulase negative staph to reduce the nitrate to nitrite. This was said to provide better flavor for the end product vs just LAB.

I was curious- why the difference? I know fermented meats are gaining popularity here so maybe it's just a new market? Or is there some other regulation that would prevent it(similar to raw vs pasteurized milks in cheese)? Or maybe I'm just totally off base :)- it was just a random thought I had thinking back on the semester and curious if anyone here is more familiar with the industry",[],2025-10-15 19:46:27

I'm trying to purchase a soluble corn fiber syrup similar to the kind popular in many low carb nutrition and supplement products today. However I'm having trouble figuring out how to go about doing this.

In the past I've purchased a similar IMO-based fiber syrup in small quantities from Amazon (VitaFiber and Fiberyum). But there doesn't seem to be an equivalent consumer product for these soluble corn fiber syrups. There appear to be several manufacturers (e.g. Matsutania's Fibersol-LQ and Tate & Lyle's Promitor) but I'm not sure whether manufacturers like this are willing to deal with direct to consumer sales in such limited quantities. I realize that they aren't going to sell me a tiny 1.2kg bottle like Vitafiber but I'm wondering if manufacturers like these are ever willing to do transactions in smaller-than-pallet-sized quantities. 

I've sent preliminary emails to these companies asking about MOQ and am awaiting their response. 

Is there a better way to approach this? Any ones in particular that are more open to smaller order sizes?

Edit 1/21/20: (For anyone who stumbles upon this later) VitaFiber announced they are releasing a new, FDA-approved fiber from a ""vegetable, non-GMO starch."" I'm assuming this will be soluble corn fiber or something similar. I emailed them and they said they expect to release it before the end of 2020. Hopefully this will be what I'm looking for.",['GMO'],2025-10-15 19:46:27

Do you associate it with culinary arts? Biotechnology? Agriculture? While food science is partly related to them, it is actually also a discipline that stands remarkably on its own. For decades, it has helped business enterprises, scientific communities, and nations as a whole.

This field of study is constantly expanding, with many scientists contributing to this interesting area.

Today, we will be talking about some of the fundamental things you should know about food science, especially if you’re interested in pursuing your academics and career under the field.

We’ll be outlining our discussion with three basic questions about food science: (1) what is Food Science? (and what is NOT Food Science?);

(2) what are some Food Science Courses or subjects?; and

(3) why does Food Science matter?

## What is Food Science and what is NOT Food Science?

Let’s first establish some definitions so we can set a primary standard on what is food science.The Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) defines food science as “…the study of the physical, biological, and chemical makeup of food; the causes of food deterioration; and the concepts underlying food processing”. In simpler terms, it’s the scientific study of food, its aspects, and how its quality can be improved through science and technology.

This gives food scientists and food technologists the role of applying principles from vast scientific disciplines to the study of food. The general end goal of food science is to improve the safety, nutrition, and availability of food, as well as improving humankind’s overall health conditions.

Food science is also an interdisciplinary area of study in which other sciences or fields (such as biochemistry, nutrition, biology, biotechnology, mathematics, physics, toxicology, engineering, psychology, genetics, and even law) come together to give a wider perspective on food science.

As you will later notice, many of the above mentioned subjects will appear as courses under food science degrees. Depending on your chosen area, you can design and implement models on your food research studies and other projects.

As we’ve mentioned earlier, food science is often associated with other fields. While it uses an interdisciplinary approach in learning, you should also learn how to differentiate them. For example, food science is related to the culinary arts in a way that the latter uses principles from the former to improve the quality of their products. To illustrate, a lot of chefs use basic science knowledge on how particular food items or components are processed and how they can maximize the benefits they get from them. These are seen in a variety of food preparation or manufacturing techniques such as freeze-drying or decaffeination.

This area of study is also correlated with biotechnology, particularly on the processing of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Here, the foods’ genetic components are altered to improve their quality. Many times, these modifications are done for a more efficient food manufacturing process and provide humankind with better and more sustainable alternatives to certain food items.

Still, food science, biotechnology, and other mentioned areas of science are all separate disciplines with their own principles and methods and should not be considered one and the same.

## What are some of the courses you will be taking under a Food Science degree?

Now moving on to the next question, what are some of the subjects you will be learning under food science? Here are some of the most common subjects you should expect to study if you are to pursue a food science degree.

### 1. Food Chemistry

To understand the chemical components of food in an in-depth manner, food scientists study food chemistry. They use their expertise to grasp the overall nature of the food items they’re studying. With more information researched, they will be able to determine the best or most suited modifications in their food manufacturing process.

Other related subjects include food analysis and biochemistry.

### 2. Food Engineering

Food engineering uses principles under the engineering field to study food. Expect that you will be using a lot of mathematical applications that can aid you in your research and experiments.

### 3. Food Safety and Quality Assurance

In these subjects, you will be learning how to check and guarantee the manufacturing process of food items to be safe and be of good, and of high quality upon completion. This also involves complying with certain standards imposed by government institutions and other business enterprises.

### 4. Product Development

In product development electives, you will be creating your own food products by using the knowledge you’ve gained from your major courses. These lessons often feature a heavy concentration on hands-on training and experiences, as well as grounded projects.

### 5. Food Law

A bit similar to food safety and quality assurance, you will learn about the different rules and regulations established by the Food and Drug Administration, and other legal concerns you need to know when working on food manufacturing.

## Why Food Science Matters

Now onto our last question, why is food science important? Throughout the reading, we mention that food science’s end goal is to make humankind’s quality of life better through studying food. But what exactly has food science done for us (and will continue to do so)?

The IFT lists five (5) paradigms to highlight the importance of food science.

### 1. Availability of Food

Food science plays a crucial role in a world where there is an increasing population and a scarcity of resources. Food science includes developing methods to contribute scientific viable solutions to a massive global struggle. This is done by carefully studying food and creating models on how to efficiently produce food.

### 2. Food Safety

As food scientists study food safety and quality assurance, they will also be finding ways on how to create safer food alternatives, especially in periods of scarcity where there are limited resources for food production.

### 3. Food Sustainability

It’s one thing to create food. It’s another to certain a source. Food sustainability has been a long-time project for food scientists all over the world. After all, humankind’s survival is of utmost importance.

### 4. Nutrition

Food science also aims to create more nutritional food alternatives to improve people’s health. The nutritional aspect of food is a significant focus in food science.

### 5. Special Foods

Special foods are made for people with a variety of health conditions and require specific nutritional needs such as food for newborns, children, seniors, and diabetics.","['GMO', 'Genetically Modified']",2025-10-15 19:46:27

I'm a professor in a program that offers a BS and MS in ""Nutrition and Food Science"". To date, although the degree is quite diluted with classes outside the scope of traditional food science, it seems we've had very good success with employers taking our graduates seriously in applications for food science positions.  
 

As a recent movement to better incorporate faculty expertise, and make something ""visionary"", and ""forward thinking"", etc., the department is considering shifting our program title to something more unique and comprehensive. Among the rough initial ideas considered:  
 

\- Sustainable Food Production  
 \- Sustainability in Food and Wellness  
 \- Food Sustainability  
 \- Future of Food and Wellness  
 \- Etc..?  
 

My concern has been that potential employers in the food industry will look at these on applicant's resumes and say ""that's not food science... next applicant!"". But, to be honest, I really don't know. Perhaps employers could find some of these appealing, forward-thinking and employable? I think perhaps the first one has the best shot at that.  
 

I would really like for our department to be inclusive of all its faculty and create a good-spirited program, but I'm quite concerned we'd be negating our students' ability to be qualified for jobs. I would very much appreciate other people's thoughts and insights on this matter. Or if anyone has suggestions of what they've seen work, that would be great as well!

I am a second year at university of Massachusetts studying food science and I was hoping for some insight by professionals in the field. ~~I am a very healthy human, who tends to avoid preserved foods, overly-processed foods, meat products containing antibiotics, as well as GMO foods. What I am realizing is that the field that I am going into might contradict my lifestyle. So my first question is are their careers in food science specifically that focus on the values that I just mentioned above? I’m thinking maybe I belong more in something like nutritional epidemiology, which would (I assume) track and test the relation between western diet and disease, which is kind of what I am fascinated/passionate about. The only thing that is stopping me from pursuing a career in nutritional epidemiology is the fact that a masters in food science have a noticeably larger salary from the research I’ve done on the matter.~~ So people working in both fields, I would love to hear your honest feedback. I plan on getting my masters, so thats a lot of money spent on education, I’m going to want to be able to pay back my loans, sooner rather than later. 
Lastly, how can I start my career? I’m a second year, I’ve been away on exchange for a year at a school that did not really offer my core classes, which wasn’t too much of a big deal because I got most of my prerequisites over with (organic chem, bio, microbio, nutrition, gen eds ect), but I am going into my third year and I have yet to step foot in a food science lab. I want to get started immediately on research experience, but I don’t even have the basic skills to start. Anyway, I feel like I have no idea what I am doing or what direction I should be going and I would really appreciate some honest input. This whole thing is really eating me up. 
	If you could tell me what type of work you do now with your degree (food science and epidemiology), how much you enjoy it, your level of education, and the school(s) you attened, I would really appreciate it. 

**EDIT**
Hey guys thanks for all your input. I get that my beliefs are stupid, just ignore them from now on. I am more interested in what type of careers you are in as well as if you went to graduate school, your quality of life as a food scientist, and lastly when did you first start doing internships.

I'm a high school student looking for some guidance on the topic of efficient food distribution. 

Malnourishment is prevalent where I come from, and so I want to study the science of food distribution. 

Perhaps if I research well enough, I can try to contribute to society by perhaps attempting to create a local mechanism of free food distribution for the EWS where I live, or atleast write a small research paper commenting on the existing mechanisms for the same. 

So, can anyone guide me on 

1) How to begin researching and familiarizing myself with the topic of food distribution amongst the poor? 

2) What are the best models I can take inspiration from or study? (for example the American food stamp model which aims at increasing food security)

3) In times of crisis, is there any standard list of food distribution methods that are followed? Im sure this depends on the nature of the crisis- so, are there natural tendencies to lean towards certain specific mechanisms for a given type of crisis like a flood for example?

4) Does there exist a cheap ""super nutritional brick"" that contains all the basic nutrients a human needs on a daily basis? Can you name a few? Are there any governments that use these in times of crisis?

A couple of months ago, I stumbled across one of my old engineering professor's Twitter accounts and saw him bashing conventional agriculture and promoting organic.  I put together some information for him to challenge his views and make him realize that the issues are not as ""cut and dried"" as he was making them out to be.  I have since shared it with a few other people, and have been encouraged to publish it online.

So, here it goes...


**A bit of background on me....**

I grew up on a family farm in Western Canada.  I studied Mechanical Engineering and graduated with my Bachelor's in 2008.  I had the top marks in my class, and received the Gold Medal in Mechanical Engineering.  I continued at the same university for two more years and completed a thesis-based Master's degree. 

Upon graduating, I worked for a small bio-energy firm  for three years and earned my P.Eng.  After finishing my P.Eng, I made the decision to leave my full time job so I could be more involved with the farm (while I enjoy engineering, the farm has always been my passion).  I continue to practice as an engineer during off-peak times on the farm with a small company that specializes in doing energy audits.

Together with my brother (who has a BSc in Agriculture (Crop Sciences)), my dad, and one full-time employee, we farm approximately 5,250 acres of farmland (roughly 8.2 square miles, or 21.2 square kilometers).  We generally grow wheat, canola, oats and malt barley, all for human consumption (not animal feed).  In a typical year, our farm produces around 8,000 Metric Tonnes of grain (imagine how many people that feeds!).

We employ a wide variety of advanced farming techniques, including zero-tillage farming, GPS auto-steer and sectional control (to avoid over-application of fertilizer and pesticides), GPS yield mapping, variable rate fertilizer applications (to target fertilizer to the areas of the field with high yield potential), and are even experimenting with the use of UAV drones for data collection.

I'm not sure what your views/experience with agriculture are, but I thought I would share some of my views on various topics that seem to come up from individuals that have concerns with modern agriculture.

**Sustainability**

One point that I often see raised is sustainability - many people feel that organic farming is more sustainable than conventional farming.  A couple points I would like to raise on this:

- Does yield factor into your definition of sustainability?  Yields in conventional agriculture are significantly higher than yields in organic farming. A meta-analysis of organic and conventional farming found that yields from organic agriculture are often as much as 34% lower than from conventional agriculture. (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature11069.html?message-global=remove)

When less food is produced from each acre of land, then more land must be brought into production.  The bio-fuels industry received a lot of criticism for causing deforestation of the Brazilian rainforests because so much corn was being used to make ethanol.  Organic farming (which produces less per acre, thus requiring more land) is just as responsible for this.

- Another factor that is often overlooked is nutrients.  One of the biggest environmental impacts of conventional agriculture is the large amounts of energy required to produce synthetic fertilizers.  However, organic farmers are reliant on conventional farmers in this area...

Determining how much fertilizer is required for a crop is a fairly simple mass balance.  The grain we harvest each year contains nutrients.  Thus, each year we must apply enough fertilizer to offset the nutrients we are removing in the grain.  We monitor this over time by having soil from each of our fields tested by a lab every year to ensure that nutrient levels are being maintained.

Organic farmers face this same challenge.  However, organic farming does not allow for the use of synthetic fertilizer.  While crop rotations can be used to satisfy some of their nutrient requirements (crops like peas and beans have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in their roots and take nitrogen from the air and make it available to the plant - and note, conventional farmers utilize this too!), they often apply manure as fertilizer.  That manure is often from animals that have been eating conventional grain (so the nutrients in the manure are from synthetic fertilizer).  A study done in [France](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/4/044045/article) found that 23% of the Nitrogen, 73% of the Phosphorous, and 53% of the Potassium nutrients (the 3 main macro-nutrients) used in organic farming were from synthetic fertilizer.  So in reality, the only difference is that the nutrients that organic farmers use have gone through the digestive tract of a cow ;)

- The last sustainability topic that I want to bring up is tillage.  Over the past 20 years, nearly every acre of grain farmland in Western Canada has been converted to zero-tillage farming.  Each spring, the new crop is seeded directly into the stubble from the previous year's crop with the smallest amount of soil disturbance possible.  This practice has drastically reduced soil erosion, it helps conserve moisture, and it sequesters carbon in the soil (in fact, farmers who adopt this practice in Alberta generate Carbon Offset credits).

I grew up in the 80's, when tillage was still the norm.  To seed our crops, we used to have to make anywhere from 3 to 8 passes over our fields.  The result was soil that was completely pulverized, bone dry, and susceptible to wind erosion.

Nearly all the fence lines in Western Canada have dirt ""drifts"" along them, from soil erosion.  My parents have pictures of me and my sister playing outside when we were young on black snow, since wind had blown soil from nearby fields into our yard.  After a windy day, rural counties used to have to send crews out to dig the soil of of the ditches along the county roads and dump it back on the farmer's fields.

Why do I bring this up?  Organic farmers are utilizing tillage to control weeds.  Still sound more sustainable than conventional farming?

**Pesticides**

Another point that I often see raised is pesticides - here are some thoughts on that...

- First of all, organic farmers use them too.  While they are not allowed to use synthetic pesticides, they are allowed to use naturally occurring ones.  However, as I'm sure you realize, not everything found in nature is ""safe"" or ""less toxic"" than synthetically made things.  Many of the ""natural"" pesticides used in organic farming are more toxic than the synthetic ones used in conventional farming.

[Here](https://twitter.com/DavidKucher/status/602649450310275073/photo/1) is a list of pesticides allowed in organic farming. 

- Newer, safer pesticides are constantly being developed.  Of the three classes of pesticides (herbicides, which control weeds; fungicides, which control plant diseases; and insecticides, which control insects), insecticides are the most dangerous.  We are fortunate in Western Canada that our cold climate does a good job of controlling insects, so we very rarely have to use them.  However, sometimes insect infestations happen and they do need to be used.

One of the major downsides of using an insecticide is that they are non-selective, meaning that they kill ALL insects in the fields (including beneficial insects that feed on the pest insects, and pollinators like bees).  As a result, farmers take the decision to use an insecticide very seriously!

Dupont has recently developed a new insecticide called [Coragen](http://www.dupont.ca/content/dam/assets/industries/agriculture/assets/cp_PSD-67_Coragen_Tech_Bulletin_Canola_E.pdf) which helps address this issue.  Rather than killing insects on contact by attacking their nervous system, the insecticide coats the plants.  When insects eat the plant, the chemical paralyzes their jaws, causing them to starve.  The insecticide has no impact on bees and other beneficial insects.

Rather than being able to embrace new products like this, organic farmers will have to continue using the highly toxic ""natural"" insecticides that they are permitted to use (such as pyrethrin - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethrin)

- Using the least amount of pesticides possible is the goal of all farmers - they are very expensive! (and we are the ones exposed to them in their most concentrated form - using less of them reduces our exposure to them).

All farmers (conventional and organic) practice Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Throughout the year, a wide variety of measures are taken to control pests, with pesticides being only one of them.

Some examples of IPM would include: establishing a healthy plant stand (through proper seeding rates) to enable the plants to out-compete pests, selecting varieties that are resistant to pests (and rotating varieties, to ensure that resistance does not break down), utilizing crop rotations (certain pests target certain crops), and eliminating areas where insects/weeds live/breed (ex: mowing weeds in ditches/abandoned yardsites to prevent them from going to seed). When a pesticide is used, the field is first scouted to verify that it is in fact necessary, the pesticide is applied at the correct rate and at the correct time, and the pesticides used are rotated from year to year to avoid developing resistance).

**GMO's**

Another topic that draws a lot of attention is genetically modified crops (such as in the March Against Monsanto this past weekend).  A few points on them...

- The scientific consensus is that GMO's are safe.  The Pew Research Center polled the membership of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and found that 88% of scientists feel it is safe to eat genetically modified food (which is greater than the 87% consensus that humans are causing climate change).  In contrast, only 37% of the general public feels that GMO's are safe.  This is the largest gap in opinion between scientists and the general public.

- There is more to GMO's than Monsanto.  For example, GMO's saved the Hawaiian papaya industry by developing a variety that was resistant to a disease that nearly wiped out that industry; GMO's are being used to develop orange trees that are resistant to a disease that is threatening the Florida orange industry; GMO's have been used to develop bio-fortified crops, such as Golden Rice; etc.

- GMO's are helping farmers to reduce the use of pesticides.  Bt crops have cut down on the amount of insecticides by making the crops naturally resistant to insect attacks.  Round-up Ready crops (resistant to the herbicide glyphosate) have increased the use of glyphosate; however, glyphosate is less toxic than the herbicides that it has replaced (ie: the herbicides used to control weeds in non-GMO crops).

On our own farm, we grow GMO canola.  The other crops we grow (wheat, oats, and malt barley) are all non-GMO (no GMO varieties are registered for use).  In the past 20 years, our canola yields have doubled (from approximately 25 bushels/acre to 50 bushels per acre), while the amount of herbicides (and their toxicity) we use have decreased.

Yields of our other (non-GMO) crops have increased too, but at a much, much slower rate (in the same period of time, wheat yields would have gone from around 50 bushels/acre to 60 bushels/acre, a 20% increase).

**Monsanto**

A lot of the public's disdain for modern agriculture is directed at Monsanto.  Here are some points on that...

- Growing GMO crops requires farmers to enter into a contract with the company that developed the seed (Monsanto, Bayer, etc - Monsanto is not the only company that makes GMO's).  Farmers are free to choose whether or not to do this (if they don't want to, they can grow non-GMO crops).  However, many farmers do choose to grow them, because the increased yields and other benefits they offer outweigh the additional costs.

One of the terms of the contract is that the farmers must purchase new seed every year.  Farmers often do this regardless of whether they are growing GMO or non-patented non-GMO crops.  Crops bred through hybridization (corn, canola, etc) only exhibit the increased plant vigor they offer for one generation, so new seed must be used each year.  For crops that don't use hybrid breeding (wheat, oats, barley, etc), breeders are constantly releasing new varieties with improved traits (higher yields, disease resistance, etc), so farmers often purchase new seed regularly to take advantage of this.

- Monsanto has never sued farmers for accidental contamination of their crops. (http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/gm-seed-accidentally-in-farmers-fields.aspx).  

They do sue farmers who breach their contract with Monsanto and save seed and replant it without paying royalties - rightly so though! Monsanto spends roughly $1 billion per year on research and development - they need to make a return on that investment.  In addition to that, if they were to allow some farmers to break the rules and not pay royalties, then it puts the farmers who do play by the rules at a disadvantage (since they have higher costs than their neighbors who are not paying the royalty).

- Monsanto is primarily a seed business, not a pesticide manufacturer.  Round-Up (glyphosate) is the only pesticide they manufacture, and it has been off-patent for a number of years.  The majority of the glyphosate used is ""generic"" (ie: made by other companies).

- Organic food is big business too.  Whole Foods (an organic supermarket chain) has yearly sales that are approximately equal to Monsanto's.

**General Comments**

A few random comments...

- ""Corporate"" farms are not big, ""evil"" companies.  My family's farm is a ""corporate"" farm (ie: it is ""incorporated"").  Many family farms do this for tax purposes.  Our farming business pays each of use a wage to live on, and the rest of the farm's profits stay in the farm and are re-invested (in land, machinery, etc).

- Like all things in life, agriculture involves ""balancing"" many competing objectives/goals. Farming requires balancing environmental conservation with the need to feed a growing population (with less labor, since trends are towards increased urbanization) at a reasonable cost (even in ""first world"" countries like Canada there are people who cannot afford to eat proper meals!).

- To me, it is important for farmers to produce food  in the most efficient way possible.  If someone is a small market gardener on the outskirts a city, and they have enough labor to grow everything ""organically"" and feel that those practices make them most efficient, then great! They should absolutely do that! However, suggesting that ALL farming should be organic, when nothing suggests that this is even possible, is a terrible attitude (and one that is only possible for very privileged, first-world urbanites).

- While some ""organic"" farming practices do have merit (as I discussed, there are lots that conventional farmers use too!), organic farming as a whole is too much about conforming to an arbitrary set of ""rules"", rather than doing what is best/most efficient.  Technology is going to continue to develop, and organic farmers are not going to be able to embrace many new things coming down the pipeline (GMO crops bred to be more nutrient/water efficient, insecticides like the one I mentioned that only target pest insects, etc).

- Technology has improved every aspect of our lives - why wouldn't we apply it to farming?  I often wonder if when the ""pro-organic"" people go to the doctor's office if they ask to be treated using technology from 70 years ago?  If not, then why do they do that when they buy food???

- Lastly, I'm going to share a TED talk on agriculture with you.  It was done by an agrologist from Alberta.  I feel it does an excellent job articulating the challenges affecting modern agriculture.  Of all the links I have shared in this email, this is the one I would most encourage you to check out :)

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",[],2025-10-15 19:46:40

I’m a 19 yo guy from an Asian country and will be starting college soon. I’ve already enrolled in a BSc Biotechnology program because the field genuinely intrigued me. I have always dreamt of doing researches and working in labs. I want to pursue further studies and eventually build a career abroad.I also like that it opens up a wide range of opportunities to explore after graduation, and I’ve always been curious about how far this field can go.

But after spending some time reading posts and opinions on Reddit, I’m starting to feel a bit of doubt and demotivation. A lot of people say the biotech field isn’t very rewarding at the moment, and that building a stable career especially abroad takes years of effort and further studies. Since I’ve already committed to this path, I’m wondering if things might look better by the time I graduate, or if the situation is unlikely to change much.

For those of you who are already in the industry or have experience with this path, what would you suggest? Should I stick to this course and plan my next steps carefully or start considering alternative routes early on?

I'm an incoming freshman at UC Berkeley planning to double major in **Genetics & Plant Biology** and **Bioengineering**. I'm really passionate about biotech and want to eventually pursue a **PhD in Bioengineering**, hopefully at MIT.

I’d love to get advice on a few things:

1. **Are these majors (Genetics & Plant Biology + Bioengineering) a strong combination for a career in biotech?** Would it make more sense to drop one and focus more deeply on the other, or are both useful in the current job market?
2. **What can I do during undergrad to make myself competitive for biotech jobs right out of college?** Are there specific internships, research labs, technical skills, or projects I should prioritize (e.g., wet lab techniques, programming, startup experience, etc.)?
3. **What kinds of jobs are available to someone with this background after undergrad?** I'm looking for realistic options that don’t require a graduate degree yet still offer meaningful work.
4. **What are the typical salary ranges for biotech roles at various experience levels?** Specifically:
   * Entry-level (BS only)
   * Mid-level with 3–5 years of experience
   * After getting a PhD
   * Industry vs. academia
   * Startup vs. big biotech/pharma",[],2025-10-15 19:46:53

FindPharmaPros aims to be the Fiverr/Upwork for the pharma industry. This has been on my mind for the last 12 months and has started to take off over the past several months. 

  
The goal is to make it easier for all of us to step into the contracting/consulting side of the business and for Sponsor/Biotechs to find those interested in consulting without the insane 20%-30% agency fees. The reality is, our industry is becoming more fragmented and words like ""fractional resourcing"" are becoming more and more prevalent with biotechs only able to afford partial FTEs. We will provide consultants with the tools and templates they need to succeed. This is all FREE to both Sponsors and Contractors.

 Personally, I was always interested in contracting but I found it hard to start and finding job postings for part time or full time contracting gigs was difficult. 

Speaking from the sponsor side, staffing is extremely time consuming, expensive, and limiting. A sponsor needs to quickly  find a  contractor who has anywhere from 5 to 40 hours a week of availability. I keep asking myself why I can build a whole admin and graphic design team (i.e. from Upwork/Fiverr) in a few minutes but it takes weeks to do the same for a clinical development team? My hope is for a sponsor to have a need, do a quick filtered search, and send out feelers to multiple candidates in minutes. This will be a marketplace for sponsors/sites/CROs/Vendors and pharmaceutical professionals. 

  
I am really curious for all of your thoughts on this. We are cumulating a waitlist and we plan to go live in the next few weeks. ",[],2025-10-15 19:46:53

I didn’t do great in high school at all (pandemic graduate). I am going to get my associates degree in biotechnology in 2025. 
My main issue is the fact that companies will come to my college, do a conference and give out their personal emails. I’ll email them and try to connect and it’s crickets. Why do they even bother to come to my campus if they just ignore every single student? I understand I will need to get my bachelor’s just I wouldn’t be able to afford that immediately. 
My current plan is to finish my associates, find lab tech work either at my college or a lab that would take me that would offer tuition reimbursement so that I can go back to school and get my bachelor’s. 
I eventually want to get my PhD in the future, that’s my end goal when it comes to my academic career path. I’m still debating on which path to go down when it comes to gaining my PhD, if I want to do molecular biology or something else. 
Has anyone been in my position before and could offer sound advice? Since graduation is soon I feel a bit lost but not so much. For my bachelors I think I should do biotechnology or something related. My end goal is to work in research. ",[],2025-10-15 19:46:53

Hey everyone, I am a year 12 biology student studying for exams and my textbooks have a few missing details surrounding genetic engineering. I've tried to work this out online, but I guess I'm not googling the right stuff.

I understand that transformed bacteria containing Ti plasmids can be used to 'infect' certain types of plants, causing the expression of the gene product. However, I'm not sure what's fully happening here; are these plasmids getting integrated into the plant genome, or are genes of interest simply just getting expressed within bacteria which are then inside the plant? If someone could explain the details of how this works, that would be much appreciated.

Similar question surrounding animal cells; I've learnt that a gene of interest can be inserted in to the nucleus of a zygote, and that it is 'randomly incorporated into the genome'. Are these recombinant plasmids being inserted here as well? Is that how plasmids work?

 I would very much appreciate if anyone could help me out.",[],2025-10-15 19:46:56

individual.

As of late, most mainstream science has exposed itself to be no more than mere

prostitutes for corporate oligarchs looking to further enrich their positions of power.

Science has become Propaganda.

This project will- NOT be following in the footsteps or display of the utterly ridiculously

controlled institutional science propaganda posing as real Science.

With that being said, we hold the opportunity to enrich the lives of all living creatures with a

higher form of compatibility, in essence systematically opening the door for

electromagnetic energy to be stored.

I am agonising over deciding which path to follow next as I feel once I choose one route or the other I am pretty much pursuing that scientific field in terms of future academia and career (forever).

My current thought process is this (verbal diarrhoea incoming):

I have always been interested in medical science and the molecular chemistry involved in disease, its treatment and drug development and having studied a module in infectious disease at undergrad i was keen to pursue this avenue.

The tissue engineering side of medical engineering grabbed me instantly due to its sci fi nature and frankly astonishing advancements and innovation - I mean bioprinting heart valves in a lab - prettyyyy crazy.

I also enjoyed studying some env. science modules due to the inherent problem solving approach to some of Earth's biggest challenges and felt this was suited to my philosophical and strategic mindset in terms of being able to present arguments/viewpoints about how to effectively consider/design/implement solutions to pressing issues of climate change, food security and loss of biodiversity - real big picture stuff.

So ultimately, my decision comes down to prospects following each Master's course.

Environmental sustainability and green tech feels like the big picture, trendier option with more versatility in terms of working in a variety of industries and there seems to be higher demand and roles/grad places when looking on job sites. I also feel like there'd be more opportunities to travel and with accreditation maybe more potential to one day work independently as a consultant.

Negatives - It doesn't excite me as much as the medical field and I feel like atm any tom, dick and harry is pushing into the env. sustainability/green jobs space.

Tissue engineering is much more specialized and small scale in terms of potential employment opportunities. The course content sounds fascinating and medical biology is my first love BUT I am terrified going down this avenue would be naive.

Firstly, in terms of potential roles out there, from a few searches on job sites it appears there isn't that much to go around, especially given the vast numbers of graduates in biomedical sciences/engineering etc and entry level positions are surprisingly low paying (23k per year!?!?)

Secondly, I worry that even if I do find a role I could just end up being a research scientist stuck at a lab bench for the rest of my life with a max earnings of 40k per year in what is actually a highly skilled role.

Thirdly, I worry that even though my MSc would be specialised, companies wouldn't recognise me due to my BSc in a broad based subject (Natural Sciences) and are more likely to hire experienced people with a good BSc grounded in the field.

So I'd be really grateful if people in biotech/pharma/medical devices could give me a heads up as to whether I have any real prospects going forward or is the best I could do being stuck as a low level worker drone in the lab?

And I'd be equally grateful if Env. Sustainability grads/consultants could let me know if the job really is all that and if it offers all the opportunities and independence companies like WSP say it does on their grad scheme ads?

Thanks in advance!",['food security'],2025-10-15 19:47:00
