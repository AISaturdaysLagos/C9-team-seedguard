"3","Literally nothing, No GMO has ever been found to be harmful over forty years of research and with billions consuming them daily. Not only are they extremely safe beyond any reasonable doubt, but they also have the potential to save the million or more people that die from starvation and the half-million or more that permanently lose their eyesight from malnutrition every year. A GMO is simply a food derived from an organism that has had its DNA altered somehow to make it bigger, tastier, heat resistant, cold resistant, etc. The way DNA is altered today is by using enzymes (little chemically active proteins) to cut open DNA and insert DNA from a different organism that has a desirable gene. That DNA they inserted is foreign and therefore people think that this must mean that it’s harmful in some way. However, while the DNA is foreign, it is still just DNA and acts just as it did in the (also edible and non-harmful usually) animal that it was taken from. Any organism you consume (plant or animal) has DNA in it anyway which still isn’t harmful… you could literally drink the stuff. If the DNA inserted coded for something toxic to humans, then it probably wouldn’t be labeled as safe to eat by the FDA.People say that GMOs “must” be harmful but that’s just it; these are just random people not scientists. No credible Scientist has ever said that GMOs are harmful. That’s not to say there weren’t/aren’t some crackpot conspiracy theorists parading around as scientists who ignore the scientific method to obtain largely falsified results that suit the imaginary point they’re trying to prove. There are a few commonly cited “studies” that supposedly prove that GMO’s cause health defect but absolutely none of them are recognized by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine who concluded that “no substantiated evidence that foods from GE crops [are] less safe than foods from non-GE crops [exists].” One notable example is a study that claimed to have found evidence that mice fed GMO’s developed tumors due to their diet. That study was complete bs for a few reasons; it had no control group (genetically similar mice fed non-GMO food to establish that the mice didn’t just commonly grow tumors anyway) which was probably because the breed of lab mouse he used is highly predisposed to growing tumors.The only logical argument against GMOs is that while known GMOs are safe, in theory, new and untested ones might not be (heavy emphasis on the “in theory”) However, any genetically modified crop released to consumers in any country has been tested and approved by the food and drug administration of whatever country it was developed in, any scientist who is cautious of GMO’s is really only cautious (with good reason) about the relaxation of the laws regarding the testing and certification of GMOs. The reason many popular chains like whole foods swear off GMOs is because it’s a publicity stunt and a marketing technique (if you think they’re above that, then you should look at that time they sold bottles of water with asparagus in them for $8 each).A poll by the Pew Center in 2015 which found that 88% of scientists think that GM crops are safe while only 37% of the public agrees; this is the largest gap in opinion between the scientific community and the public over any existing issue, including climate change.TL; DR Nothing.I got a 5 on the AP Biology exam, I got a 5 on the AP Statistics exam, and I had the privilege of writing a research paper on GMOs in AP Language and composition.","2019-04-14T00:31:59.344Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo0NTg5MDQ5Ng==","1","45890496","Are GMO's safe for general human consumption, if so, what effects do they have?","https://www.quora.com/Are-GMOs-safe-for-general-human-consumption-if-so-what-effects-do-they-have"

You can pretty much discard any of these arguments without further consideration. For example:GMOs are bad because plant patents.All plant varieties can be patented. GMOs can be patented. Organic varieties can be patented. Conventional varieties can be patented. Crossbreeds can be patented. Hybrids can be patented. Yes, Karen, that 100% certified USDA organic kale you buy at Trader Joe’s is patented. The first plant patents were issued in the 1800s.GMOs are bad because monoculture.GMOs were originally designed, among other things, to prevent monocultures. Farm moncultures began with large-scale farming of conventional crops, like dwarf wheat. Conventional, not GMO.The intent of GMO crops was to be able to engineer huge numbers of varieties that would prevent monocultures. You could tailor crops to the exact conditions of your farm; farmers in Nebraska would no longer plant to same varieties as farmers in Kansas.Fear of GMOs scuttled that.I look at monocultures the same way I look at climate change. Greenpeace whipped up irrational terror and hatred of nuclear power, so utility companies stopped building nuclear plants and started building coal plants. Then Greenpeace wept bitterly about climate change.Greenpeace whipped up irrational terror and hatred of GMOs, so seed companies stopped developing small-scale, individually tuned GMOs and started selling the same varieties to everyone.

"55","No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.","2014-08-04T14:38:10.138Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyMjU0MTYx","8","2254161","Are genetically modified foods harmful to human health in the long run?","https://www.quora.com/Are-genetically-modified-foods-harmful-to-human-health-in-the-long-run"

"7","They don’t. “America” doesn’t insist anything, because “America” is not a person.Now, to actually answer your question:
GMOs are genetically modified plants and animals. Essentially, that means that their DNA has been altered. The change could make the food unfit for human consumption, but it’s unlikely for the food to get through regulatory bodies if that’s the case. Meanwhile, the change could also make the food better. For example, Golden Rice is a genetically modified type of rice with extra vitamins, designed to combat vitamin deficiency in poor countries.The countries that have banned GMOs often have corrupt or poorly funded regulatory bodies, meaning that some “unsafe” GMOs can get past them. That doesn’t mean that GMOs are inherently unsafe, it means that a very small percentage of them are unsafe, and you need well-funded regulatory bodies to filter out the bad ones from the good ones.Summary: Most GMOs are safe, although they still need to get approved by regulatory bodies before being sold, and the countries which have banned them (usually developing countries) just don’t have enough money to fund the testing of them.","2018-09-07T02:10:51.830Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozMzk3OTgyOQ==","12","33979829","Why does America insist GMO’s are safe when several countries have banned them for being unsafe?","https://www.quora.com/Why-does-America-insist-GMO-s-are-safe-when-several-countries-have-banned-them-for-being-unsafe"
"2","There are safe to eat, that yes.It is not clear what the impact will be on the meat industry as it´s actually them who are investing heavily in this technology.The problems are on one side that they still use Foetal Bovine Serum, from unborn calves, to grow the lab meat. You are thus wasting a calf that could be reared directly for slaughter and produce quality meat.And quality is a problem, because the lab grown ”meat” is nothing like real meat, thus muscle tissue, but just a clump of cells, almost like pink goo, but even pink goo has better texture.Actually, to add texture what they use is… fake soy meat (!). You are thus also wasting what could be a perfectly normal piece of vegan filet.Even though they resolve the problem of the FSB and manage to grow the stuff in 100% plant based serum (something that seems feasible at a short term) and they manage to solve the problem of texture, creating real muscle tissue (something that will take way longer), it still means one extra manufacturing step as compared to using the plants to create fake meat directly.It is thus a kind of a Rube Goldberg-ish scheme that will not satisfy anybody as it is more complex and thus expensive than either fake plant based meat or traditional farming.I am tempted to say that the two or three start ups that are into that are just there to make what most startups do: Make a big PR stunt, cash in on some venture capitalist, try to get sold out to Google or Facebook and enjoy a golden retirement at 30.

"26","You can take this question in one of two ways.  If you want to answer the question \proactively label their GMO-containing foods?\Justin Ma has a great answer.  I take the question to mean \regulations that require them to label food that contains GMO-derived ingredients?\I will focus on the United States, since that is where I am most familiar with the regulatory environment. Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do. Basically, the people who just claim that mandatory labeling laws would just \For those who insist on providing information to consumers, there is a way you can do this: label your own products the way you want, and don't force others to do so.

"4","Yes, there is. The scientific community has been in consensus for decades. Most of the world’s scientific academies (nearly 300) have issued statements in support of GMO safety, based on literal thousands of independent studies, mostly run by scientists without any financial ties to any agribusiness company.More than 280 scientific and technical institutions support the safety of GM cropsThese statements are a fair sign that a consensus exists. Consider the question of cigarette safety, or lack thereof. Scientists had been studying it for decades, and the evidence kept showing that cigarettes cause lung cancer. Eventually, the amount of data became overwhelming and scientists reached a consensus. In 1954, a newspaper reported that a link between smoking and cancer had been found “beyond a reasonable doubt.” That same year, the American Cancer Society's National Board of Directors announced that smoking is linked to lung cancer, “without dissent.” This was followed shortly by the Public Health Cancer Association (USA), Study Group on Smoking and Health (USA), British Medical Research Council, Swedish Medical Research Council, International Union Against Cancer, and so on and so forth. At this point in time, it can be stated, the scientific community had reached a consensus. This is 10 years before the 1964 US Surgeon General’s Warning Report, however, and many doctors were still unaware that cigarettes cause cancer up until then. The scientists were in consensus, but the public, including doctors, was not aware or accepting the facts. We are in the same position regarding the safety of GMOs today: the scientists are in consensus, but the public has not accepted the facts.Note that a scientific consensus does not mean unanimous support. There are indeed some vocal anti-GMO scientists who have published anti-GMO papers, however they are a tiny, tiny percentage of the whole. The number of papers on GMO safety numbers in the thousands, most performed by independent scientists [not by corporate-funded scientists as the anti-GMO lobby claims], and most concluding that GMOs are safe. The anti-GMO research tends to be low quality and published in journals that do not practice peer review. A few have even been retracted [which, like the original “vaccines cause autism” paper, is done when a paper is severely flawed and dishonest]. This is why meta-analyses are important: they look at all the papers published, remove those of poor quality, and try to find what the overarching pattern is: the signal through the noise. Remember that an experiment can always lead to a false-positive or false-negative by chance. This is why repetition and a large sample size is important, and why, to find a consensus, you need to read systematic reviews or meta-analyses rather than single experiments.More and more meta-analyses of the evidence continue to be published, and the conclusion is always the same: no evidence of harm, ample evidence of safety, and even evidence for benefits to the environment in addition to increased yields, increased well-being for developing-world farmers, lower mycotoxins, etc. The evidence for GMO safety is overwhelming.A Meta-Analysis of the Impacts of Genetically Modified CropsImpact of genetically engineered maize on agronomic, environmental and toxicological traits: a meta-analysis of 21 years of field dataConsider evolution: the scientific consensus is that evolution is a fact, yet Creationist scientists and even biologists still exist (about 3% of scientists in the USA), and still sign letters saying that there is no “consensus” on evolution. However, these scientists are predominantly not actually studying speciation: a physicists’ views on evolution are as irrelevant a biologist’s views on string theory. Similarly, their numbers are thoroughly dwarfed by the numbers of scientists who accept the fact of evolution (97% in the USA). When a Creationist organization came up with a list of 100 scientists who reject evolution, the US National Center for Education came up with a list of over 1000 scientists named Steve who accept evolution! More than 10 times as many people, and they all share the same name! A similar list for GMO safety could be made easily.There is absolutely a consensus on the fact of evolution, the fact that vaccines do not cause autism, the fact that cigarettes cause lung cancer, the fact that GMOs are safe, etc. The existence of scientists who reject these facts does not weaken the consensuses.","2015-09-01T05:16:47.373Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1MTI3MzUy","20","5127352","Is there a consensus on GMO safety?","https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-consensus-on-GMO-safety"

It is the implication that GMO garden seeds are dangerous… and the fact China might sell them without labeling them GMO to endanger consumers.I have bought garden seeds in the United States, and very firmly believe that every seed has been sourced from U.S. growers…. in fact, I have never heard of or seen imported garden seeds at a local farm supply or garden center. That may be based on a mistaken assumption that such seeds would actually be labeled as imported… but the names, Burpee, AlaFlo, and others are U.S. feed producers, so it seems like a safe bet.Now the question about GMO garden seeds. Developing a GMO seed is a very expensive and serious process, between the laboratory work getting the seed started, to testing and meeting regulatory requirements to market it, and garden seed suppliers, unlike Monsanto, really don’t have a lot of incentive to modify their products. GMO seed are very often produced to resist the effects of chemicals used on fields where the crop they represent are grown. Garden seeds don’t fall into the same category as soybeans, corn, cotton, and sugar beets.

Kids often prefer a cherry or grape tomato to a full-sized on , as they are easier to eat and can serve as quick snacks. If a scientist could synthesize a gene which would increase lycopene production in cherry and grape tomatoes so that each one contains the same amount as a full-size tomato - is that a bad thing?Or, to keep it in the realm of already existing genetic material, we can return to oranges for a moment . Oranges are very susceptible to frost. There is a species of banana that can be grown in the Midwest of the US , and is hardy down to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. If the hardiness gene from that banana could be isolated and injected into frost-susceptible oranges , resulting in a longer growing season for those oranges. does the fact that humans have interfered in nature make the result somehow evil or wrong?I don’t mean to be Pollyannaish here, but genetic modification is a tool. I’m sure it is used in ways that wouldn’t have the health of consumers as the primary focus , but that’s the ethical issue with all technology. Technology itself is value-neutral - it’s up to us to use it toward positive ends.On a more personal note, I was a fruititarian neo-hippie in the 90’s. There’s no question in my mind that, on balance, GMO fruits and vegetables are healthier than many of the ones I dumpster dived (dove?) back in the day.","2019-01-31T01:09:20.314Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo0MTU1NTAyOA==","22","41555028","It is safe to be a vegetarian with all of the GMO fruits and vegetables out there?","https://www.quora.com/It-is-safe-to-be-a-vegetarian-with-all-of-the-GMO-fruits-and-vegetables-out-there"
"6","I think that GMO’s are safe, yes.I think that Glyphosate use may be out of control and quite possibly misused.For one, the companies that now manufacture it (China) are not under any particular QA or QC rubric to insure that it is not contaminated. Second, use of it very quickly selects for ‘weed’ populations that are resistant; not so much to the glyphosate itself, but resist it’s absorption, such that the Spreader-Sticker on the application (in the required slightly acid environment of the application) fail to function. The reaction by applicators would be to increase the Spreader-Sticker content, which doesn’t seem to be specifically addressed in the critical reviews of potential environmental impact of such compounds on the theoretically present soil micro-organisms.In short, the damage caused by over-use of a foliage-active compound instead has become a soil additive in practice, and the necessary over-use of acid-friendly wetting agents in the mix confound the evaluation of actual glyphosate chemical bi-product interactions. The extraordinarily cheap price of Glyphosate makes over-use of it too easy perhaps, as the labor-intensive individual targeting of weeds is ignored, and given over to the application of a ‘blanket’ (perhaps drench) spraying on everything with a spreader-sticker content for the worst weeds possible.In ornamental applications I have seen Glyphosate not work on resistant weeds, yet if the same weed species has the same dose ‘brushed on’ (with a rubber brush applicator, as you find cheaply in any paint store), then the treatment ‘takes.’ If farm applications developed an automatic system that could ‘target’ specific weeds in a similar manner (and yes, the technology is quite do-able), then the ‘drenching’ over-use could be avoided. For some row-crops, such a ‘targeting’ device might impinge on the necessity of having a GMO crop planted altogether.","2018-08-30T11:59:24.677Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozMzYxMzI1MQ==","23","33613251","Do you think GMO and glyphosate are safe and why?","https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-GMO-and-glyphosate-are-safe-and-why"

You have indirectly consumed a GMO modified plant.Apples? Sugarbeet? Yeah, unless you some how avoided any Soda or any other of the multitude of products that contain sugar.A few examples:SoybeansThe second largest U.S. crop after corn, GM soy is used primarily in animal feed and in soybean oil—which is widely used for processed foods and in restaurant chains. In fact, soybean oil accounts for 61% of Americans' vegetable-oil consumption. It's also often used to make an emulsifier called soy lecithin, which is present in a lot of processed foods, including dark chocolate bars and candy.CanolaGM canola is used to make oil for cooking, as well as margarine. It's also used to produce emulsifiers that are used in packaged foods. By some estimates, 90% of canola grown in the U.S. and Canada is GM.Ah…but you ask should we? We have very little choice in the matter, there are ways around it.

"2","According to scientific literature, the concerns about GE food consumption that emerge from scientific and social debates can be summarized in the following points:Safety of inserted transgenic DNA and the transcribed RNA
The DNA sequences that stimulate the expression of transgenes in plant cells are generally derived from either viruses or bacteria. Concerns have been expressed on the possibility that the the transgenic DNA may resist the digestion process, leading to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to bacteria in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or translocation and accumulation into the human body. However, some considerations can help to put this issue in context:Transgenic DNA is enormously diluted by the total amount of ingested DNA and is digested like any other DNA.Food processing usually results in DNA degradation, further reducing the amount of intact DNAIn most studies conducted thus far, no fragments of transgenic DNA were detected in animal-derived productsHGT of transgenic DNA to GI bacteria of humans and animals is estimated to be an extremely rare occurrence. 
But in the unlikely event that this happens, worst case scenario is that antibiotic resistance genes get transferred to GI bacteria, making them resistant to clinical therapies.And most importantly, no evidence has been obtained to date that DNA absorbed through the GI tract can be integrated into the cells of the host organism and lead to a germ line transfer.Safety of the protein(s) encoded by the trans genes
GE crop developers submit documentation of several analyses of the transgenic protein to the competent authorities during the approval phase that precede that commercialization of a GE crop. 
The experimental data collected so far on authorised GE crops can be summarized as follows:There is no scientific evidence of toxic or allergenic effects of these proteinsPre-screening of transgenic proteins via bioinformatic analyses contributes to avoid the introduction of potentially toxic, allergenic or bioactive proteins into food crops.During the digestion process the proteins generally undergo degradation that leads to the loss of activityEven though there are some examples of some ingested proteins that are absorbed in minute quantities in an essentially intact form, the consumption of transgenic proteins contained in the authorised GE crops does not result in any detectable systemic uptake, and transgenic proteins are usually rapidly degraded are not detectable in animal derived products such as milk, meat, and eggs.The application of the concept of “history of safe use” to the choice of transgenic donor organisms may increase intrinsic safety and simplify safety assessment procedures.Safety of the intended and unintended changes of crop compositionSafety of the introduced change in the GE crop is usually evaluated during the determination of compositional equivalence. However, on a case-by-case basis, additional analyses can be requested, such as that of processed foods or feeds, nutritional equivalence and 90-day rodent feeding tests with whole GE food or feed.It’s important to note that, at the moment, the route to the authorization of GE crops intended only for industrial purposes is not fully clarified by the legislation. However, the results of animal tests are routinely presented to the European safety assessment authorities, even if not explicitly required.References:This answer has been adapted from An overview of the last 10 years of genetically engineered crop safety research.I would also recommend watching this documentary of GMO food License to Farm - Official Documentary","2017-08-01T11:30:58.851Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxNzYyNzgyNA==","25","17627824","Why are the GMO foods considered safe with such a short period of studying?","https://www.quora.com/Why-are-the-GMO-foods-considered-safe-with-such-a-short-period-of-studying"
"3","GMO salmon produced by a company called Aquabounty Technologies, have been approved for sale in Canada, and may soon be approved for sale in the US. The genetic alterations in the fish do two things. They enable the fish to produce natural antifreeze (something several species of arctic fish do naturally) and they turn on a growth hormone that allows them to put on weight much faster than they would otherwise.The fish reach market weight in half the time of unmodified fish, and consume about 25% less food. The antifreeze enables the fish to be farmed in colder waters, instead of migrating south, which is what wild Atlantic salmon do.Genetically engineered fish could provide a solution, taking the pressure off wild stocks and reducing the energy and carbon emissions required to feed the world’s seafood appetite. Because AquaBounty’s salmon are sterile and raised in land-based tanks, they can’t breed with wild populations. And because they efficiently convert fish feed into edible protein, they offer a potential low-cost solution for nourishing not only affluent consumers in North America but hungry people in the developing world with little access to meat.The regulations regarding sales and labeling of genetically modified animals in the US are complicated. The fDA needs to approve their sale, because bioengineered animals are classed as drugs.Because Health Canada concluded that these salmon are “as safe and nutritious for humans and livestock as conventional salmon,” labeling was optional and left up to the discretion of the grocers who distributed the filets.In the United States, the regulatory landscape is less straightforward. When it comes to GMO foods, “[regulators] found existing laws and stretched out the scope of those laws to cover biotechnology products,” Hallerman said, “and it’s awkward.”The FDA has approved the GMO salmon as safe back in 2015, but the need to resolve labeling regulations and coordinate with the USDA, which oversees and approves GMO plants, has slowed down the process of getting the fish into US markets. Governments are anxious to get safe GMO animals into production because they see them as an alternative to overfishing endangered wild populations.The salmon being developed and farmed by Aquabounty Technologies are all female, and are supposed to be sterile, to keep them from breeding with wild populations. The eggs are produced in a facility on Prince Edward island in fresh water. The idea is that if they escape, they will be non-viable in salt water. There seems to be some doubt about that last bit. Right now, the eggs are shipped to Panama, and they are not being farmed in open waters. That may change if the issues with crossbreeding and sterility are finally resolved.The salmon eggs AquaBounty produces are all female, and their number of chromosomes has been modified to make them sterile, like seedless watermelons. However, this process is not 100 percent successful, and Hallerman and others worried about the potential for these fast-growing salmon to escape and mix with wild populations.The FDA says the salmon are safe for consumption by humans and animals. Then again, you can also find things like this.Oxitec is owned by Intrexon, which also owns AquaBounty—the maker of GM salmon. The research on the salmon did show indications of off-target effects, with higher amounts of a cancer promoting hormone (IGF-1) and larger allergenic potential. But the number of fish used in the study was so small that the changes were not statistically significant.Off target effects are mutations other than the ones intended by manipulation in the lab. The study apparently included only six fish.Genetically engineered salmon may be coming to a store near youhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/08/04/gmo-salmon-caught-in-u-s-regulatory-net-but-canadians-have-eaten-5-tons/?utm_term=.6685529887c5Research Exposes New Health Risks of Genetically Modified Mosquitoes and Salmon","2018-10-30T05:50:12.722Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozNjY4NjUyNw==","26","36686527","Is GMO salmon safe to eat?","https://www.quora.com/Is-GMO-salmon-safe-to-eat"
