2hoq8f,Every comment critical of GMOs I make on reddit is down-voted to hell.,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMO/comments/2hoq8f/every_comment_critical_of_gmos_i_make_on_reddit/,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMO/comments/2hoq8f/every_comment_critical_of_gmos_i_make_on_reddit/,ajsdklf9df,GMO,2014-09-28 11:40:57,3,101,0.52,"So perhaps in this sub I can get educational replies in addition to the down-votes.

Here are my main problems with GMOs.

1. In the developed world the agricultural market is a train wreck of government interference. We over-produce food, we waste a lot, we  have massive subsides, price supports and various marketing restrictions. Into this mess we add GMOs. They are in my opinion not in any way necessary for developed world consumers. 

2. But they could lower prices! Sure. But not as much as reducing the government interference would. If your primary concern is lower food prices, start with the regulations and trade restrictions.

3. But they reduce pesticide use! They reduce some pesticide use, and increase the use of others.  But the ones they increase could be better than alternatives! Sure. One worse alternative - Atrazine was banned in the EU years ago. And hopefully it will be banned in the US and Canada too eventually. Plus weeds tend to adapt to pesticides. But only if people use the GMOs and pesticides wrongly! True. But people are people. They will always screw up.

4. By GMOs are more profitable! Sure, they are good for agricultural producers. But in the developed world those are already hugely subsidized. Why would I want to help them even more? For a developed world consumer GMOs seem genuinely superfluous at best.


5. Organics use pesticides too! Sure, but I am only aware of two types of grandfathered organic pesticides. First: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotenone
Luckily in the United States and Canada, all uses of rotenone except as a piscicide are being phased out. And second copper sulphates. But copper has very low toxicity. You'd have to consume a huge amount to have any problems. Source: http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/cuso4gen.html

6. But GMOs can help to make things better! Maybe. Recent research indicates genetic engineering lags behind conventional breeding in efforts to create drought-resistant maize: http://www.nature.com/news/cross-bred-crops-get-fit-faster-1.15940  Beyond that, better is relative. The most common tomato in the US is know as bulletproof because it takes a lot of abuse without problems, thus it is easy to transport. For any for-profit company the main focus is profitability.  That profitability results in better tasting, or better in any way foods, only if that is profitable. As ""bulletproof"" tomatoes show, taste is not always on the path to the most profitable type of food.

7. Norman Borlaug!!!

Norman Borlaug is great, and here is why:

Nothing he did involved GMO, it was just traditional breeding.

It was a public project, the resulting seeds were released for free for everyone to use. 

It used pre-existing wheat varieties. He used a Japanese dwarf variety to get stems strong enough to not collapse under the weight of the extra grain.

What's different about GMO:

GMOs tend to be privately funded and owned, and seeds are licensed.

 Mono culture. Where is the next special variety going to come from, if everyone around the world grows the same variety? From where could we quickly borrow a stronger stem from, or natural resistance to a new wheat rust?

    
To me Norman Borlaug is the best possible counter-argument for GMOs. And I have no idea why so many people use him to defend GMOs?






8. But GMO could  help the developing world! Yes, they could help a little But the primary reason for hunger in the developing world is not lack of food, but lack of infrastructure. Source: http://www.wfp.org/hunger/causes Still, I am not against GMOs in places where they actual can help. Which is not in the developed world. I especially like this research: http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/genetics/turbo-tobacco-faster-photosynthesis-17217730 Even if it still missing half the way bacteria photosynthesis works, it is a great start. And a  35-60% increase of crop production could make a major difference even without improvements in transportation.

9. But Golden Rice!!!!

The ""Golden Rice is an effective source of vitamin A"" paper: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/6/1776.full.pdf  Includes the following experimental design:

>Golden Rice plants were grown hydroponically with heavy water (deuterium oxide) to generate deuterium-labeled [2H] b-carotene
in the rice grains. Golden Rice servings of 65–98 g (130–200 g cooked
rice) containing 0.99–1.53 mg b-carotene were fed to 5 healthy
adult volunteers (3 women and 2 men) **with 10 g butter**. 

I guess the butter was necessary since carotenes are hydrophobic, and there needs to be a sufficient amount of fat present in the diet for golden rice (or most other vitamin A supplements) to be able to alleviate vitamin A deficiency. 

Sadly the people in the developing world who suffer from vitamin A deficiency, lack food, especially high caloric food like fatty foods. Thus Golden Rice does not seem like it could help much without more fat in the diet. But fat itself can contain vitamin A, butter has vitamin A. Golden Rice by itself seems insufficient to cure vitamin A deficiency. A varied diet containing foods rich in beta carotene such as sweet potato, leafy green vegetables and fruits could prove just as effective.

The bottom line is that GMOs might be of some help in the developing world, but in the developed world they are at best utterly useless to consumers.

So are GM foods safe? Well there are 2 ways to look at this question. Option 1 is to look at it from a societal view, that being will it harm humans if they ingest this modified food. The answer to this point of view is no, GM foods really won’t harm you if you eat them and you probably already eat GM foods and don’t know it. Now GM foods can cause allergic reactions more often than the regular ones but the Pros far outweigh the Cons. Now Option 2 is looking at it from the eyes of a farmer. GM crops tend to have a negative impact on soil health and crop diversity. One of the articles that came up during research had this to say about GM crops, “The use of some GM crops can have negative impacts on non-target organisms and on soil and water ecosystems. For example, the expansion of GM herbicide-tolerant corn and soy, which are twinned with herbicides, has destroyed much of the habitat of the monarch butterfly in North America.” Whilst not being completely environmentally friendly it is still a great alternative to help with the growing hunger demands.",[],2025-10-15 19:14:14

One topic being hurt by the increase in misinformation is GMO foods. While no links have been observed between negative health impacts and GMO foods, people seem dead set on their perceived dangers. That being said, the U.S Government should give a grant of 5 Million USD to Monsanto(the leading producer of GMO seeds) to combat the misinformation surrounding the topic and to fund further research. This would help farmers because of the added simplicity of growing insect-resistant crops, as well as the consumers that would enjoy the lowered price on many agricultural goods. Overall, GMO crops are the future of agriculture. Countless diseases(Like Anemia) could be addressed with fortified crops(like yellow rice–an iron-fortified crop).

Important note: the vegetative health data (VHI, drought, TCI, others) provided by STAR has only been updated through week 25. This means the satellite data, which already lags, is now behind, approaching two weeks. There is no explanation why.

**USA Update**

The weather outlook in the USA has improved for most areas other than the western corn belt, which will get hot from Kansas all the way north into Canada. The western Dakotas and Nebraska areas will reach 6 to 10 degrees above normal in the second week.

VHI updates will improve for the USA when the data is updated. AiQ’s models are again approaching the corn yield trend due to a mild forecast driven by cooler temperatures across the corn belt. Monday’s forecast provides the first look during the most critical growing period.

**World Update**

The GFS and Euro show almost no moisture over the next two weeks across Eastern Europe and the Black Sea. Highs will be in the 90s, even reaching into low triple digits. This is 6 to 10 degrees or more above normal for the core-producing areas of Romania and Bulgaria.

Canada is another area to watch as Saskatchewan and Alberta will see temperatures reach 8-12 degrees above normal in the southern growing areas of the provinces. Wheat, canola, and oats will be the main crops affected.

Early Russian wheat yields are confirming AiQ’s bias that the last six weeks of weather were better than maps showed for winter crops. Private forecasters began revising estimates in early July following AiQ.

China’s weather remains problematic. Inner Mongolia remains hot and dry, but storms will arrive just to the south. Areas will receive 6 inches or more over the next 7 days, but the areas to the north will remain in a state of doubt. This area accounts for one-quarter of the corn crop.

The FAS update on Brazil's soybeans is a must-read because the agency has begun to address the divide between local agencies and USDA figures. The global soybean balance sheets in 2024/25 could see large adjustments later this year.

Climate change is one of the most critical obstacles, as conventional agricultural practices contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and weather fluctuations that can harm crop production.

Land usage is another problem, with farming methods causing deforestation and habitat loss while expanding cities makes agricultural land scarce and increases food insecurity. Water scarcity is also a significant issue, with agriculture being the biggest consumer of freshwater resources worldwide, and climate change exacerbating the problem in some areas.

# Benefits of vertical farming over traditional agriculture

Vertical farming involves growing crops on top of each other rather than in horizontal rows. By utilizing space more efficiently, vertical farming allows for the conservation of natural resources. This agricultural method is typically practised indoors where environmental conditions can be carefully controlled to optimize plant growth. Here are the key benefits of vertical farming over traditional agriculture:

1. Higher crop yields per given space

Utilizing vertical space instead of horizontal rows, allows farmers to grow more food in less space. As a result, vertical farms can produce more food per square foot of land than traditional farms. This advantage is becoming increasingly important as the expansion of industrialization and urban areas with high population density is resulting in a decrease in arable land for agricultural purposes.

2. Reduced water use and run-off

Vertical farmers require 70% - 95% less water than traditional farmers. This is achieved through the use of hydroponic systems, which are at the core of vertical farming. Water and nutrients are recirculated to the plant roots multiple times, so there’s much less waste or runoff.

3. Reduced arable land use

Vertical farming offers a promising solution to the dwindling availability of arable land caused by industrialization and urbanization. By utilizing spaces like rooftops or abandoned buildings, vertical farms require much less land than traditional farming methods. This not only alleviates the strain on available arable land but also enables the growth of crops in urban areas where land is scarce. Due to this versatility, vertical farming holds the potential to enhance food security in densely populated cities while also mitigating the environmental impact of food production.

4. Reduced transportation

Building vertical farms in urban areas or close to consumers significantly decreases the necessity for long-distance transportation and its associated costs. This approach not only lowers the carbon emissions caused by food transportation but also allows consumers to access fresher produce with ease. As a result, vertical farming is a more environmentally friendly way to produce food.

5. Reduced dependence on weather and soil quality

Crops may be cultivated year-round in vertical farms without being impacted by unpredictable weather. This is achieved by closely regulating variables such as temperature, humidity, and lighting.

Also, by cultivating crops in soilless media, these farms can decrease the demand for fertile land while simultaneously ensuring consistent production of fresh produce throughout the year.

6. Reduced risk of pests and diseases

Vertical farms offer a tightly controlled and contained atmosphere, effectively eradicating the threat of pests and diseases that frequently plague traditional agriculture.

These meticulous control measures ensure that harmful chemicals and pesticides are unnecessary in vertical farming, which yields healthier and safer crops for consumers. Moreover, the absence of these toxic substances is better for the environment and our health.

The weekend focus should have been the evolving two-week forecast, but instead, traders are trying to sort out Friday’s June Stocks and Planting Report. There is no other way to say it; this was a terrible miss by the USDA. Similar to 2020, where markets were signaling rising demand for months, but the agency stuck to its guns. China bought over 20 million tons of corn before significant balance sheet updates were made. The agency has a lot of discretion on these reports. 

Tuesday is a holiday, so futures will attempt to price the 4.6 million acre soybean reduction on Monday and then wait to see what weather forecasts bring Wednesday morning. Analysts were talking about next year’s soybean ending stocks at 400 or  500 million bushels a week ago, and now pipelines could be below minimal levels on paper. 

Corn was down 20% last week, and traders will continue exiting long corn versus short oilseeds positions in the coming days. Whether the USDA proves closer this time, these are the numbers until July WASDE's yield update. That report just got much more interesting. 

USA corn Vegetative Health Index (VHI) has improved from a week ago, but social media is ablaze with pictures of corn knocked down from hail and the mild derecho last week. It is very tough to validate just how much damage was done. 

Canadian weather will be another area to watch. Europe is generally in good shape, so an oilseed or canola story must come from North America. The forecast remains dry with models diverging on temperatures. Any significant heat will trigger short covering in the coming weeks. 

China and the USA continue on a path of escalation as China’s commitment to the Putin regime is unwavering. The Foreign Relations Law was passed and hardens Beijing’s position against any foreign interests-namely the USA, and Europe and Japan to a lesser extent-that threatens China’s sovereignty. The phrase “drinking from a firehose” refers to a human’s inability to process too much information at once.  This is exactly what is happening and undoubtedly worsening by the day.

As a result, modern farms are benefiting greatly from [digital farming technologies](https://digiworldofagriculture.blogspot.com/2022/03/New-Technologies-In-Agriculture-Applications.html) that are constantly evolving. These benefits include reduced consumption of water, nutrients, and fertilizers, reducing negative impacts on the surrounding ecosystem, reduced chemical runoff to local groundwater and rivers, improved efficiency, reduced costs, and more. Thus, the business becomes profitable, smart, and sustainable.

## GIS Technologies In Agriculture

Because fields are location-dependent, GIS technology becomes an incredibly useful tool in terms of precision agriculture. Using geo-information technologies in agriculture, farmers can display current and future changes in precipitation, temperature, yields, plant health, etc. It also allows the use of GPS-based applications along with smart technologies to optimize the application of fertilizers and pesticides; given that farmers do not need to cultivate the entire field, but only in certain areas, they can achieve savings in money, effort, and time.

Another big benefit of GIS technology used in agriculture is the use of satellites and drones to collect valuable data about vegetation, soil conditions, weather, and terrain from a bird's eye view. Such data greatly improves the accuracy of decision-making.

### Satellite Data

Yield forecasting and near-real-time satellite monitoring of fields to detect a variety of threats using satellite data have never been easier than with the introduction of innovative technologies in agriculture.

The sensors can provide images in a variety of spectra, allowing multiple spectral indices to be applied, such as the Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI). NDVI allows you to determine the composition of the vegetation, the number of withered plants, and the general condition of the plants. Next comes the Plant Chlorophyll Content Index (CCCI), which helps with nutrient input. The Normalized Differential Red Edge Index (NDRE) then determines the nitrogen content. Finally, the Soil-Adjusted Modified Vegetation Index (MSAVI) is designed to minimize the effects of background soil in the earliest stages of plant development; the list goes on.

### Drones: Technology Data From the Sky

With the help of unmanned technologies in agriculture (drones), farmers have the ability to determine crop biomass, plant height, weeds, and water saturation in certain areas of the field with high accuracy. They provide better and more accurate data with higher resolution than satellites. When they are on the ground, they provide valuable information even faster than scouts. Drones are also considered unsurpassed assistants in the fight against insects; Insect infestation is prevented by applying insecticide to dangerous areas using unmanned technology (drones) while reducing the likelihood of direct exposure leading to chemical poisoning.

Although drones are easy to use and capable of collecting large amounts of data in a short time, there are still challenges in their continued use as the technology is not cheap. Drones are almost helpless where mapping or monitoring of large areas is required, and it is better to complement this technology with satellite monitoring of already mapped areas where specific areas need to be rechecked.",[],2025-10-15 19:14:17

I'm not an expert in any way when it comes to agriculture, but I have had a keen interest in doing as much research as possible on this subject. I've been quite disturbed to find that very few groups are actually performing feasibility studies of any kind; the majority of articles (of any kind) suggesting a radical change in agricultural practices do not penetrate the complexity of agricultural systems whatsoever. They make arguments like ""Field corn could just be eaten by humans instead of being fed to cows, and if not we could use that same land for more nutritious crops"". They cite broad numbers that are convincing to the uninitiated, but they roundly have no sweet clue how to give their proposals a sanity test/reality check.

So here I am, hoping to get some information from people with real world experience in the agri-industry...

I have learned that field corn is a very robust crop which often grows on land that will not sustain many other varieties. I've also learned that field corn is easily harvested, transported, and stored/silo'd (can be stored dry/requires no refrigeration). On-top of that, field corn isn't very nutritious, and can be processed into high-glucose-fructose corn syrup, which is perhaps the opposite of nutritious...

**Given these issues (with field corn alone), how feasible would it be to convert the land currently used for field/feed corn into land suitable for fruits and typical produce vegetables (the kinds required by a meat free diet)?**

**Furthermore, what impact would such a massive change have on the cost ease of harvesting, transporting, and storing a nationally adequate diet?**

**Since field corn can be easily stored in silos, giving us a steady year-round supply of it, how would crop** ***seasonality*** **affect our ability to meet national dietary requirements after such a change?**

**Regarding livestock which is raised on rough forage (land utterly unusable for corps) in more traditional farming styles, is it actually economical? (can farmers turn a profit without subsidy?) In other words, would the loss of livestock on such farms cause them problems? (such as loss of fertilizer and source of profit).**

I have a lot more questions relating to the need for fertilizer (and the environmental impact comparisons between natural and synthetic fertilizer), and some additional questions pertaining to crop decision making (how to decide what to plant), the *nutritional* feasibility of a feed-corn/bean heavy diet, more questions relating to food distribution networks, and more questions relating to the usefulness of animal by-products, but they're perhaps too numerous to burden this post with.

I do believe that as a society we should eat less meat, and I also believe that, ethically, factory-style farming is too horrendous to be worth it. I want the world, and us, to be healthier, more efficient, and to harm fewer animals, but I don't see a clear path toward the immediate achievement of this. In a world where healthy alternatives are already sold at a premium, advocates are claiming that switching to plants-only would be cheaper and healthier overall, and that the environment can be saved in the process. It just seems too good to be true; that they're screaming fruitlessly from the rooftops instead of actually answering the technical and logistical dilemmas of how to achieve their (our) goals.

With the massive growth the industry sees every year, as at 2017 the global food and agriculture industry was valued at about 8.1 trillion in dollars, yet getting quality food is still largely a problem to be solved. The bulk of the problem is not in the shortage of food supply but in the quality of good food available for consumption.

Modern or new ways of farming which range from genetically engineered animals to using chemicals such as pesticides and other methods of improving crop and livestock yields has not helped. The problems are replete which include but not limited to health problems, hazardous to biodiversity in this time of endangered species, and of course reduces the potential yield of the soil itself.

Organic farming has shown that many of these health problems and imbalance on the ecosystem can be comfortably taken care of quite naturally if we resort to this style and method of agriculture. Sadly, percentage of organic foods in the global food industry is so small, valued at $90 billion from 1999 to 2016 which is just 1.1% of the value of the global food industry. This stunted growth in organic food supply emanates from myriads of challenges that militate against the boom of the organic food production system. Big organizations out there who are bent on raking in the billions but care less about the adverse effects of genetically engineered foods and their accompanied methods of production do almost anything to maintain the status quo.

Well of course, as many as the problems plaguing our world is, so are the possible solutions to reducing and eradicating these problems. This is actually what the Green World Farm project seeks to achieve. With their revolutionary idea of making organic food very much popular and accessible globally through its adoption of the blockchain technology to bring about value chain expansion.

How has GWF proposed to solve this problem using blockchain? Reading through their whitepaper they have a clear cut strategy of leveraging on the smart contract under the Ethereum blockchain. The need for a trustless system is well taken care of with the smart contract system. Breach of trust and contracts which affects farmers can be well taken care of using the smart contract model as farmers can start producing after entering into an agreement with buyers of their produce knowing fully well that their payment is guaranteed as it’s been managed under the Ethereum smart contracts system. Blockchain offers a means for farmers to contract with sellers to grow what is needed. Full or partial payment can go into escrow immediately to guarantee payment to the farmer without breach of contract and coercion by marketers. Getting paid for labour is a big challenge in the farming world, and Blockchain can alleviate part of that through smart contracts.

Having checked through the amazing idea and the fact that they have ready farms and the farmers from an agricultural rich nation like Nigeria with a known reputation of high quality yield of agricultural produce due to its very fertile soil and good climatic condition which favours farming, and of course the fact that the US farms will become operational in the near future causing even greater expansion for the farmers as the project progresses along its roadmap, I think the GWF project is one project to keep a close eye on and perhaps invest in their ICO which starts on May 14, 2018 12pm UTC and ends on July 14, 2018 11pm UTC

The farmers of the American midwest practice some of the most technologically sophisticated agriculture in the world. American agriculture is fully mechanized, makes heavy use agriculture inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, and reliant upon mono-cropping highly lucrative crops such as corn and soy. This is in stark contrast to Tanzania, where many farmers use the same implements they would have a thousand years ago, and where yields are a fraction of what they are in the United States. It is easy to assume that these poor peasants are a dead weight on agricultural development, and the transforming the Tanzanian economy will require replacing peasant farming with modern agriculture. Development policy under colonial rule, socialist rule, and the current capitalist government have all been based on these assumptions. Today’s podcast will be looking at the disastrous consequences of these assumptions.

The United Kingdom, the colonial power that ruled Tanzania, was suffering from major shortages and inflation in the aftermath of WWII. The government of the time, decided investing massively in large scale peanut farming in Tanzania would both help alleviate cooking oil shortages in the UK and bring agricultural development to Tanzania. Between 1948 and 1951 the United Kingdom through the the state controlled Overseas Food Corporation invested $2.9 billion in modern currency. From the beginning, the plan was a fiasco. The Port of Dar es Salaam did not have the equipment to handle the massive influx of agricultural equipment and the only railroad connecting the selected site to Dar es Salaam was washed out in floods. The OFC failed to plan for the massive influx of workers clearing and preparing the land for farming, forcing many into unsanitary tent cities. Most importantly, the farming itself proved to be far more difficult than expected. The American tractors broke down in transportation. The high clay and quartz content of the soil baked into something near concrete, wearing the plough shares down. Most famously, the OFC attempted retrofit WWII tanks into agricultural bulldozers. In the end, total peanut production was minimal. The groundnut scheme was only one of many failed British agricultural programs in Tanzania. Many tried to micromanage the lives of farmers, telling them how to farm their land and raise their livestock, while having little idea of the realities of farming in Tanzania.

Tanzania gained its independence from Great Britain in 1961, and its new socialist leadership under Julius Nyerere promised a completely new direction, guided by the ideology of Ujamaa (which translates to family-ness in Swahili) a form of African socialism. However, the new administration inherited many of the biases of the previous colonial government. The socialist government intervened far more forcefully into the lives of ordinary farmers, the most intense example of which was uprooting up to 13 million farmers from their traditional farmsteads and concentrating them in large villages. The official justification was that it was easier to provide health and education services, yet from an agricultural perspective they were a failure. An example of this failure was that of Mbarali Farms, a large rice farm created as an aid project by the Chinese government between 1971 and 1977, investing approximately $82 million in current dollars, to construct a highly mechanized rice farm. However, after transfer to Tanzanian authorities, the rice farms suffered from the same problems as the groundnut scheme. The Mbarali Farms mechanized methods struggled to manage water levels and weeding, and yields at Mbarali Farms decreased by 60% between 1980 and 1989. Nearby African peasants, using traditional benefits and not benefiting from foreign aid, had rice yields about 15% higher than those at Mbarali Farms.

However, the same attitudes towards farmers have changed slowly under the pro-market governments that took over after Nyerere stepped down from power. An example of this can be seen in the government of Tanzania’s encouragement of large scale global agro-business to grab land, to farm with modern methods. One example of these failures are Sun Biofuels acquisition of 20,000 acres of uncultivated forest in the region of Kisarawe. The local farmers made use of this land for water, lumber and other forest products. Sun Biofuels promised 4,000 jobs for locals, and promised to invest in roads, hospitals and rural infrastructure and so the farmers allowed to farm this land for only a nominal fee. The jatropha plantations suffered the same fate as the Groundnut Scheme and Mbarali farms, and the jatropha crops failed under Tanzanian conditions. A collapse of global commodity prices, and the jatropha plants lack of resilience to drought and local pests doomed the project. Moreover, only 44 jobs were created for locals, as the project relied heavily upon mechanized methods. The land did not revert to the farmers after the collapse of the jatropha crops, and was acquired by Mtanga Foods, a Tanzanian agrobusiness company to raise cattle.

Foreign investment, modern technology, and mechanization all play an important role in modernizing Tanzanian agriculture. However, these methods need to be adapted to Tanzanian conditions, and especially the needs of Tanzanian farmers if they are to succeed. Farmers need access to fertilizer, irrigation, and high yielding seeds to succeed. Moreover, they need access to quality extension services that respects the farmers understanding of the land he farms, and adapts the latest technology to the situation on the ground. In recent decades, government policy in Tanzania has been moving in this direction, and the results have been impressive. Between 2006 and 2016, maize production has increased 71%, rice production 247%, and sweet potato production 275%. The results match those in green revolution countries such as India and Indonesia. Tanzanian farmers, if given the right tools and incentives, can match farmers anywhere in the world for productivity.

**Seed Treatment Fungicides Market: Introduction**

Seed treatment can be defined as treating seeds with additionally required chemicals such as Imidaclorpid 48% FS, Metalaxyl 35 WS, and others, that are used to biologically improve the seeds quality and protect the seeds. This process is used in order to control diseases and infections caused owing to soil borne infections, false smut, fungal disease, blight and root rot, termite bunt, and loose smut, among others. Fungicide seed treatments aids in protecting seedlings from getting effected due to both seed pathogens and soil. Seed-borne pathogens are those accommodated on the seed surface, or those located in the inner part of the seed. Soil-borne pathogens contaminates the seed or seedling, which is the main cause of the growth of both non-parasitic and parasitic diseases.

**Market Dynamics**

Some of the major factors driving the seed treatment fungicides market include the increasing demand for genetically modified seeds, coupled with rising use of fungicides for crop protection is fueling the market growth. As the fungicides ensure high farm yields, and also improve the protection from harmful organisms, the demand for seed treatment fungicides is expected to grow. Moreover, increasing demand for feedstock such as farming seeds will further enhance the product demand over the projected period.

The market is expected to restrain due to the increasing use of treated seeds among farmers. According to Agricultural Health Study (AHS), more than 90% of farmers in North Carolina and Iowa use seed treated seeds only, while very few farmers are using fungicides for seed treatment. Moreover, according to FAO stats, Iowa led the U.S. corn production in 2015, which was followed by Nebraska and Illinois. Both these states produced over 2 billion corn crop bushels in 2015, while states such as Indiana and Minnesota produced only 1 billion corn bushels in 2015.

**Market Segmentation**

The seed treatment fungicides market has been categorized into crop type, product type, process, form and geography. On the basis of crop type the market is segmented into integrated cereals & grains, oil seeds, fruits & vegetables, flowers & ornaments Seed. Based on product type the market is categorized into captan, difenoconazole, biological agents, carboxin, and PNCB among others. Seed treatment fungicides market based on process is divided into seed coatings fungicides, seed dressing fungicides and seed pelleting fungicides among others. Form segment is segmented into powder and liquid. Seed dressing fungicides is the most regularly used technique, this is majorly due to easy procedure and low cost when compared to others. Economical earthen pots are used for mixing chemicals with seeds otherwise seed can be spread on a polythene sheet and essential quantity of chemical can be sprinkled over the seeds and mixed automatically by the farmers with the help of machinery. Seed dressing fungicides technique is basically a biological process, which is being used in various crop types such as in pigeon pea, sugarcane, chilies and tomatoes among others.

**Regional Analysis**

North America accounted for the largest market share in 2017. Strict government regulations towards curbing and reducing the use of agrochemicals such as pesticides along with growing consumer awareness regarding the presence of fertilizer remains in the produce, has resulted in a substantial growth in demand for seed treatment fungicides. As per the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA); seedling-blight diseases and smuts caused in barley, wheat, oats, and others can be controlled by seed treatment fungicides, that helps to kill the infections causing diseases inside the seed during germination. Asia Pacific market is anticipated to be experience a swift growth in the seed treatment fungicides market over the forecast period. According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, in 2017, India and China are the key producers of wheat globally. As per a article published by FAO in 2017 India produced 93.34 million tons of wheat in 2017.

The city of Manila had almost been totally destroyed in WWII. Population grew at around 3% a year, and the economy could barely keep up. Per capita incomes were a fraction of those in America, and the gap was growing even larger. Localized outbreaks of famine were common, and the average Filipino consumed 1,790 calories a day, 18% less than the caloric minimum. The hunger and poverty fueled social rebellion, and thousands of peasants were in armed revolt against the pro-American central government.

In 1798, Economist Thomas Malthus famously predicted that the exponential growth of human population would inevitably lead to mass hunger and famine. By the 1950s, it appeared those predictions were coming true. Famine and instability increasingly plagued large chunks of the developing. Rapid developments in public health allowed many countries to grow by over three percent a year, and food production could not keep pace. Rice is the most food crop in both the world and the Philippines, and both needed a miracle in rice production.

Soil Health and the Organic Cure: Agriculture Solutions Driven by Blockchain Tech

Soil Health is a very important aspect of the Agricultural Industry, the Health of the Soil determines its viability and profitability of crop production and related agricultural practice. Extensive use of chemicals like inorganic fertilisers on the soil results in soil degradation and general decline of soil health. The way forward appears to be organic agriculture powered and driven by modern technology

Technology and its attendant advancements over the years have been greatly beneficial to Agricultural Development and the drive towards global food security. The advent of modern farming techniques and implementation tools have assisted in this development, however this was not without great cost to the environment.

Current cultivation practices and intensive farming systems have largely been responsible for degrading soil health in various farmlands over the world. Studies have pointed out severally that soil degradation as a result of agricultural practice is very real and very alarming. Chemical intrusion- like the continuous application of inorganic fertilisers- on the soil, has been a particularly important factor in soil degradation. In fact this article, while generally focusing on the influence of modern intensive farming systems on soil health, specifically focuses on the effect of heavy use of chemical fertilisers on the same said soil and how this challenged is being tackled.

Not to get too technical, there are two major problems surrounding the issue of fertiliser application and soil degradation as it is obtainable today in which this article looks to address: one is the direct and adverse effects it undoubtedly has on the soil; effects like contamination, fertility degradation, erosion disposition and so on and the other is the alarming ignorance and lack of neglect surrounding the issue of chemical intrusion and soil health.

Regarding the first issue, the negative effects of inorganic fertilisers are quite numerous and well documented. Some of these are discussed below;

Soil Friability Effect

Inorganic fertilisers are mostly composed of chemicals which undergo chemical reactions and produce acidic substances in the soil when applied copiously. The presence of some of these acids cause friability in the soil. Friability occurs when these acids dissolve soil crumbs; causing the soil to lose its compactness. Soils become loose, less rich in organic matter and generally prone to erosion due to poor soil drainage. Over time, the soil is washed away by nature making it less suitable for agriculture. The soil degradation process that results from friability is quite widespread in areas where fertilisers are largely used.
Depletion of soil organic matter

Soil biology shows that up to 30 percent of soil composition consists of soil organic matter. Organic matter present in the soil are made up of living and dead matter. Living micro-organisms are very important to soil and plant health. The help create pest and disease resistance for plants and are also responsible for important processes like nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis. Extensive use of chemicals on the soil have been reported to adversely affect living organisms in the soil. Causing imbalance and soil degradation on a considerable scale.

A Solution Driven by Technology

The problem of soil degradation caused by inorganic fertiliser application can be addressed by simply changing the tools. The need for fertilisers as an indispensable resource for boosting agricultural crop outputs and enhancing yield quality has not only been long established, it has also proven to be a ‘must-use’. With this in mind, it goes to follow that farms must use fertilisers, but not necessarily inorganic ones. Therefore, the need for widespread use of organic fertilisers has never been more apparent. The problem has always been matching the demand needed to replace inorganic fertilisers. By their very nature, organic fertilisers are difficult to produce because of the fact that materials are less available and the process requires better technology. This is why companies like Organicco have invented revolutionary technology in a bid to match the demand for organic fertiliser and other similar organic enrichment technology.

The ecoHERO™ is a extraordinary machine that is able to convert organic waste like; commercial kitchen waste, household or industrial foods waste, farm waste etc into organic fertiliser which is just as effective as its inorganic counterpart and usable for general cropping systems. The machine is available for fertiliser production by the company and has a very high investment yield rate because of waste conversion and in-farm fertiliser production as opposed to inorganic fertiliser purchase. What is more important is that products like this are important in the bid to improve soil health and combat growing soil degradation.

The good news is that Organicco like many modern successful companies has seen the potential for improving their business and promoting their vision by using Blockchain Tech as a means to secure investment and assure the future of their company. The company is scheduled to hold An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) event this month with the aim of attracting investors who can provide funding, as little as £0.40 GBP per token, for the development of the organisation.

The Blockchain Advantage

What then are the benefits of the Organicco ICO https://organicco.uk? After all, organic agriculture is not an IT powered solution or at least not in sufficient manner to necessitate the use of Blockchain tech. The answer is rather quite simple, a look at their Whitepaper and Landing page gives credence to the idea of an ICO. The company intends to use the ICO as an investment sourcing avenue, where investors are essentially buying into the company and profiting from its development and activities in a rather large but relatively untapped market space.

Another justification for their foray into the cryptocurrency space is to provide solutions to the second challenge highlighted above, one of ignorance and general lack of concern as regards soil degradation and soil health. From previous discussions with one of the founders, the company intends to provide a knowledgebase aimed at sensitising the wider population about the benefits of organic Agriculture as well as the evils of chemical and high-intensive driven agricultural practices.

Finally, the company has taken to launching a global payment solution for international trading of agricultural commodity. The solution, easiPayer uses Blockchain Technology to implement a “low cost international payment platform designed to replace letter of credits and invoice factoring that is fast, safe and easy to use”.

These developments indicate that Organicco has a real strategy in place for tackling soil health and developing their organisation in such a ways as to be profitable to investors. It remains to be seen how well the company fares in the crypto space and how well embraced their initiative will be going forward.

Recent trial data from the labs of Dr. Kris Lambert at the University of Illinois supports that Holganix’ organic plant / soil probiotic is a cost effective solution to control nematodes. In addition to its action as a bio-nematicide, Holganix has been validated in commercial and university trials across over 20 crops (row and specialty produce) to increase yield and reduce inputs (water, fertilizer and other chemicals). The 800+ beneficial microbes in Holganix provide multiple modes of action to increase nutrient uptake (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) by the plant, fight pests and disease, improve plant health and vigor, improve soil health, and reduce erosion and fertilizer run-off.

Pros and cons of each type,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/6tkup9/what_kinds_of_organic_fertilizers_pros_and_cons/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/6tkup9/what_kinds_of_organic_fertilizers_pros_and_cons/,quyquyen87,Agriculture,2017-08-14 09:14:33,0,0,0.5," Currently, farmers are standing in the matrix matrix of organic fertilizer with hundreds, thousands of brand names, uses, components, ... different. So people need to know and understand the organic fertilizers to make intelligent choices, select quality fertilizer products, suitable for cultivating crops to achieve fruitful results. High in agricultural cultivation.

I. What is Organic Fertilizer?

     Fertilizers containing micronutrients, micronutrients, in the form of organic compounds, used in agricultural production, derived from feces, animal waste, Handles, residues, leaves, byproducts from agriculture, peat or organic matter from household waste, kitchen, seafood factories ... when fertilizing soil Organic fertilizers help improve soil fertility, increase soil fertility by providing nutrients, humus, microorganisms to soil and plants.

Classification of organic fertilizer

Organic fertilizers are classified into two main groups:

Traditional organic fertilizers such as manure, green manure, compost, etc.

Organic industrial fertilizers such as bio-organic fertilizers, organic fertilizers, microbial organic fertilizers, microbial fertilizers and mineral fertilizers.

 
1. Traditional organic fertilizers

     Livestock, by-products of agricultural production, agro-forestry-fishery processing, garbage, green manure, etc. are processed by traditional brewing techniques. Traditional organic fertilizers generally have a slower effect, longer processing time and low nutrient content.

A cage

     Manure is derived from faeces, animal urine (poultry manure, cattle, feces). Prepared by traditional composting techniques and methods.

Advantage:
     Manure consists of macro, medium and micronutrient nutrients supplied to the plant, provides humus for soil improvement, increases fertility, softens soil and stabilizes the soil structure, Development, limited erosion, drought.

Disadvantages:

Low nutrient content in large volume, high transportation cost, labor intensive.

Without thorough processing or use of fresh manure, it will carry many pathogens to plants such as fungal spores, bacteria, viruses, weed seeds, insect-feeding pupae ... or egg-laying eggs, Influence on human health.

 B.Phân xanh

     Green manure is commonly referred to as fresh plants or leaves processed by composting or buried in soil to fertilize crops and soil.
Advantage:
     Green manure has the effect of protecting, improving land, reducing erosion.
Disadvantages:
     When green manure is buried on the soil, organic decomposition (decomposition of green manure) occurs, which often results in toxic substances such as CH4, H2S, etc., which cause organic toxins. Green manure has a slow action and is only useful for lining.

 C

     These are the traditional methods of composting from straw, stems, leaves from agricultural production.
Advantage:
     Garbage manure improves porosity, stabilizes soil texture, limits soil erosion and drought tolerance.
Disadvantages:
     Garbage has low nutrient content, processing is complex and takes a long time. And can carry disease germs or weed seeds available in the source material (remnants of plants for composting).

Straw to compost waste

D.Than mud

     Peat does not directly fertilize but must be processed for use in plants.
Advantage:
     Peat is good for fertilizer application, increasing soil fertility as well as organic soil.
Disadvantages:
     Low nutrient content, complex processing should be applied in large amounts both costly and costly.
 
2. Organic fertilizer processing according to industrial processes
Organic fertilizers are made from a variety of organically derived organic compounds in industrial processes up to thousands of tons, applying scientific and technological advances to produce fertilizers. Fertilizer is better quality, full of nutrients compared to raw materials and traditional organic fertilizers.

Phan-bon-huu-co
Organic fertilizers are produced by industrial processes

A.Fertilizer micro

     Fertilizer is a component of one or more useful microorganisms, including: organic microorganisms, nitrogen fixation microorganisms, parasitic microorganisms, microorganisms Resistance, microbial degradation of cellulose, ...
Advantage:
     Supplementation promotes the development of soil micro-organisms, solubilizing difficult-to-absorb plant species into plant-readily absorbed forms, synthesizing a number of nutrients for plant major crops such as N, Control pathogens that exist in the soil, improve the efficiency of the use of fertilizer.
Disadvantages:

Fertilizers do not provide or only provide a moderate amount of nutrients (from nitrogen fixation microorganisms, phosphorus-decomposing microorganisms, etc.) to crops that are insufficient to supply. Enough and balanced nutrients for plants.

There is a shelf life and each type is highly dependent on crop groups. For example, fertilizer nitrogen fertilizer is suitable only for legumes, ....

Microorganisms must have organic matter as a food source to grow the fertilizer and supplement the fertilizer to feed the livestock, thus raising the cost of organic fertilizer.

B. Bio-organic fertilizer

     Is a fertilizer product made from organic materials mixed and fermented by the presence of one or more beneficial microorganisms to increase and balance the nutrient content needed. Set for the plant. There are over 22% organic ingredients.
Advantage:

It is possible to fertilize all stages of the crop: basalting, applying, fertilizing, ...

To provide adequate and balanced mineral nutrients necessary for growing plants, healthy development, increasing productivity and quality of agricultural products.

Add a large amount of humus, Humic acid, Humin, .... It improves the chemical - biological - physical properties of the soil, limits the washout of nutrients and soil erosion, and decomposes toxins in the soil.

Supplement promotes the development of microorganisms that help to control pathogens in the soil, provide natural antibiotics to increase the natural resistance and resistance of plants to pests and diseases. Benefit from weather, limited pests.

Increases the absorption of nutrients from the soil by providing microorganisms that are difficult to absorb (difficult to digest), easy to digest, easy to digest, easy to digest. People and creatures are useful.

Disadvantages:
     Organic bio-fertilizers are usually expensive compared to other fertilizers, but the cost is not a problem, as a return on higher costs but with better quality will increase productivity and quality. The amount of agricultural products, thereby improving economic efficiency and income. In addition, it will minimize or eliminate the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, thereby reducing the cost of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to ensure human health.

C. Organic micro-fertilizer

     The product is processed by industrial process from various sources of organic material, fermented with one or more beneficial microorganisms, containing live spores. Contains organic content of more than 15%.
Advantage:
    Provide enough mineral nutrients, medium, micronutrients for plants, improve soil fertility, porosity. Provides microorganisms that disintegrate difficult-to-absorb substances into easily absorbed, antimicrobial, parasitic, ... soils that inhibit the growth of pathogens in soil, Plant resistance, no pollution of the environment, no toxic to humans and useful organisms.
Disadvantages:
     Normally the content of organic matter is less than the organic fertilizer.
D. Organic mineral fertilizers

     Organic fertilizers and mineral fertilizers, including N, P, K. Contains less than 15% organic ingredients, 8-18% total inorganic (chemical, N + P + K).
Advantage:
High levels of mineral nutrients.
Disadvantages:
Long-term fertilization is not good for soil and soil microflora.

[Micronutrients include copper (Cu), boron (B), manganese (Mn), chlorine (Cl), iron (Fe), molybdenum (Mo), and zinc (Zn)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agro/). They have acquired a lot of attention in the agriculture in recent years. Now it is possible to give plants added micronutrients by using foliar sprays and supplements designed for better plant health. If the supply of one or more of these elements is inadequate, yields will be reduced and the quality of crop products will be affected.
For micronutrients to be essential for plants, they need to satisfy three criteria: 

* (1) the plant cannot grow and reproduce normally without the element, 

* (2) its action must be specific and unable to be replaced by any other micronutrient, and 

* (3) its action must be direct. The agriculture micronutrients market has gained worldwide importance in the recent past due to its effectiveness in terms of quality and productivity of crops.

Zinc deficiency is the most abundant micronutrient problem throughout [the world which is affecting many crops, including the staples namely, rice, corn, and wheat](https://www.reddit.com/r/agro/). Boron deficiency is the second-most widespread micronutrient problem. Copper deficiency is important in some parts of the world, such as Europe and Australia. Iron deficiency is important in some regions, especially those in with Mediterranean climate and calcareous soils. The deficiency in micronutrients content results in stunted growth, withering of buds, yellowing of leaves, etc.

This research classifies the global agriculture micronutrients market on the basis of types, application modes, forms, crop types, and geography. Soil, foliar, and fertigation are the three application modes of agriculture micronutrients. Soil application has the largest share in the global agriculture micronutrients market. The micronutrients can be applied in chelated or non-chelated form. Chelated micronutrients form has dominated the global market

The North American agriculture micronutrients market is anticipated to show potential growth in the next five years. The largest global agriculture micronutrients market is for zinc. The market is anticipated to flourish in the next five years. With the huge market potential and growth, the market is likely to witness a significant change in the industry.

The report provides a complete analysis of the world's leading players in the agriculture micronutrients industry, with a clear insight and commentary on the developments and trends. Major demand in the agriculture micronutrients market is anticipated to come from countries like China, U.S., Canada, Indonesia, Poland, Italy, Brazil, India, etc. The report provides a complete exploration of the existing segment of the industry and the competitive approaches adopted by the major players in [the agriculture micronutrients industry](https://www.reddit.com/r/agro/).",[],2025-10-15 19:14:17

I became a scientist because I wanted to make a difference. I had prepared myself for a life of numbers, statistics and working in a lab. Never did I imagine that I would be travelling to places like Colombia and Kenya, and getting to meet other researchers from around the globe who are also pretty keen to make a difference. But this is exactly what I am doing in my current role as a Newton Fund (http://www.newtonfund.ac.uk/) Postdoc at Rothamsted Research (http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/) .

The human population is growing and feeding everyone whilst limiting environmental damage is a huge challenge we face. Key to tackling the problem is understanding and managing soil. Soil is amazing and complex! It has many essential functions, including regulating water flow and water quality; storing carbon so less of it reaches the atmosphere as the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide; and supporting above and below ground biodiversity, which includes the plants we rely on for food.

I am working in collaboration with scientists at the Centre for Tropical Agriculture (https://ciat.cgiar.org/) in Cali, Colombia and Nairobi, Kenya, to understand how growing different combinations of plants effects soil function in grazed grasslands. This will help us determine the best plant varieties and farming practices to ensure farmers in the tropics grow grass to rear healthy livestock, and produce sufficient nutritious food with less damage to the environment.  Read more about my work and find out what life as a globe-trotting soil scientist is like in a recent blog entry (http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/day-life-research-scientist/day-life-dr-claire-horrocks).

My name is [Alex Lu](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/chensheng-lu/) and I’m Associate Professor of Environmental Exposure Biology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I study the decline of honeybee populations around the world. My team’s research has traced the collapse of honeybee colonies [to a group of pesticides called neonicotinoids](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/colony-collapse-disorder-pesticide/), and we’ve also published studies showing just how [widespread these pesticides are in some areas](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/pesticides-found-in-most-pollen-collected-from-foraging-bees-in-massachusetts/). [Here is a link to the full 2012 paper](http://www.bulletinofinsectology.org/pdfarticles/vol65-2012-099-106lu.pdf)


The honeybee decline is a critical issue and the future of global agriculture—and our food supply—hinges on our ability to address it. Approximately one-third of the foods we commonly consume—apples, pears, blueberries, strawberries and so on—require pollination, and honeybees happen to be the most effective pollinator for agricultural production. The European Union (EU) has already taken action. Since December 2013, the EU has banned three most widely use neonicotinoid pesticides in crops that attract bees for pollination. Ontario, Canada also passed a bill in 2015 to restrict neonicotinoids uses in agriculture. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently in the midst of a review of neonicotinoids.

As someone who started off as a drug designer in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries I have always had a keen interest in natural products.

A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible and get the most use out of them, then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life. Can we take this forward in plant and crops science, and industries?

While state initiatives have legalized two main types of Cannabis, marijuana for medical or recreational uses has gotten a lot of attention lately while the effort to revive industrial hemp production in the U.S. is much less well known.  This ancient crop traveled with the colonists to North America and was a staple of agricultural production in the U.S. up to the 1930s. Since then it has been largely illegal to grow hemp in the U.S., though it was legalized in Canada in 1998.
 
Now, though, the 2014 Farm Bill allows some controlled plantings of hemp in any state that has an agriculture department willing to oversee production for research purposes. Many vegetarians and vegans know the hemp seed – called grain – is rich in essential amino acids and fatty acids.

I’m Samuel Myers, a senior research scientist in the [Department of Environmental Health](http://environment.harvard.edu/about/faculty/samuel-myers) at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and I’m here to talk about Planetary Health. As part of my Planetary Health research, I lead five multidisciplinary research teams investigating 1) the global nutritional impacts of rising concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere; 2) the health impacts of land management decisions in SE Asia associated with forest fires and particulate air pollution; 3) the nutritional impacts of reduced access to wildlife (bushmeat) in the diet in Madagascar; 4) the local (in Madagascar) and global consequences of fisheries decline for human nutrition and health; and 5) the impact of animal pollinator declines on human nutrition at a global scale.  Planetary health is a growing field focused on understanding the many ways that human transformation of all of Earth’s natural systems—the climate, oceans, land use, freshwater systems, and other ecosystems—impacts human health.

I recently authored two studies in The Lancet that showed changing environmental conditions around the globe caused by human activity could negatively impact the health of millions of people by altering the amount and quality of key crops. [One study](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__press.thelancet.com_pollinators.pdf&d=BQMFAw&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=hMRQJhgOvYw54BmzGyI5dP_MGlC6IHgqBzg_KHnsyKw&m=__BR8w1dxVt6I0JZtsV4caFuvQMwASgp06xN8wv1ON0&s=sv4tgzslCqcBWPVKksWvTNxW6zrRYFXqhbEdD66NePE&e=) found that decreasing numbers of food pollinators such as bees—falling in part due to pesticide use and destruction of habitats—could lead to declines in nutrient-rich crops that have been linked with staving off disease. [A second study](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__press.thelancet.com_CO2zinc.pdf&d=BQMFAw&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=hMRQJhgOvYw54BmzGyI5dP_MGlC6IHgqBzg_KHnsyKw&m=__BR8w1dxVt6I0JZtsV4caFuvQMwASgp06xN8wv1ON0&s=5KgLzzCoT94gHW_6pMJS1TSnX_xYjWQ3QMOAC9IliLc&e=) found that increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) could lead to lower levels of zinc in food and thus to greatly expanded zinc deficiency.

I’m Jon Entine, a science journalist and founder of the Genetic Literacy Project and Epigenetics Literacy Project (501c3 as the Science Literacy Project), which cover the intersection of human genetics and agricultural sciences with public policy. 

In recent years, I’ve written dozens of articles about honeybees, wild bees, neonicotinoids, plant pests and the critical importance of pollinator health on the GLP, Huffington Post, Forbes, Wall Street Journal and elsewhere. My reporting — examining the research and interviewing the top entomologists — has shown that claims of mass bee die offs (bee-appocalypse) due to pesticides grossly misstates the data. Managed honey bee populations are increasing or stable in North America, Europe and worldwide and wild bees are not endangered. 

Numerous factors that have led to some problems in bee health. What I believe are advocacy-based explanations for manageable health challenges, and recommended solutions--bans of effective, low impact pesticides--are simplistic and will do more harm than good.

I’ve written three books about the politics of food and farming, including ""Let Them Eat Precaution: How Politics is Undermining the Genetic Revolution in Agriculture"" and ""Crop Chemophobia: Will Precaution Kill the Green Revolution?

I’m Neil Brown, a fungal biologist and a BBSRC Future Leader Fellow at Rothamsted Research in the UK.


In my school leavers book, my friends were asked “What will Neil end up doing?” They answered “saving trees”, to which I laughed. But it appears that they knew more about me than I did, as I now devote my days to understanding plant diseases, contributing to the knowledge and innovation needed to develop new ways to protect our crops.


New approaches to control fungal diseases that threaten our food security and health, through the contamination of crops with harmful toxins, are urgently needed. To achieve this, I am asking: how does a fungal pathogen landing on a plant decide if it is a suitable host; how does it know where to infect or where to find the best source of food; and how does it know when to deploy different virulence strategies, such as the secretion of toxins or hydrolytic enzymes?


These are the questions I hope to answer in my study of fungal ‘touch and taste’ receptors, similar to those found on our tongue. I will focus on Fusarium, a fungal pathogen that cause disease on wheat, barley, rice and maize. The goal is to determine whether these fungal ‘touch and taste’ receptors are biological targets that can potentially be drugged to prevent a pathogen from causing crop diseases and toxin contamination.


It would be great to discuss my research with you. So go ahead. Ask me anything. I will be back at **11am ET (4pm BST)**. In the meantime, you are welcome to find out more about me, and my international experiences as an early career researcher, in a blog entry I recently wrote for Rothamsted Research’s ‘A day in the life of a Research Scientist’ blog series (http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/day-life-dr-neil-brown).

Spelt huller.  (if this question can be asked somewhere else please tell me. If my English its pain on your eyes feel free to teach me) 

A friend of mine is a farmer, and he is looking for a machine to remove the chaff of his spelt production.
So, here I am, looking it the power of reedit can handle this. 

**What is spelt:** Spelt (Triticum spelta) is a hexaploid species of wheat. Spelt was an important staple in parts of Europe from the Bronze Age to medieval times; it now survives as a relict crop in Central Europe and has found a new market as a health food. Spelt is sometimes considered a subspecies of the closely related species common wheat (T. aestivum), in which case its botanical name is considered to be Triticum aestivum subsp. spelta.


**What is a huller:** A rice huller or rice husker is an agricultural machine used to automate the process of removing the chaff and the outer husks of rice  grain. Throughout history, there have been numerous techniques to hull rice. In more recent times the processes are mechanized, and the machine is called a huller, or rice huller. These machines are most widely developed and used throughout Asia.

The common idea is to shake grains and have them collide and scratch each other and container-walls, thereby loosening the outer husk and then blowing the lighter husk away. Other methods pass the grains between rubber rolls or other soft material, this is often less damaging to the grains.


**Where is the problem?**
Spelt its a kind of wheat not as common as the regular wheat, and the machines to work on it are expensive.
My friend is a farmer with a long family tradition, and this tradition is fighting against his will. He would like to move his production to be more respectful with the environment but has no much money to spend on this 'change of productivity'. He will be able to spend 1000 or 2000 euros.


Can anyone help me to help him?

Thanks.

Gadaa is the indigenous system of governance used by the Oromos in Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Oromo have a very rich culture, fostered by the size of the population and large land areas with diverse climatic conditions. One highly developed self-sufficient system which has influenced every aspect of Oromo life is the Gadaa system. It is a system that organizes the Oromo society into groups or sets (about 7-11) that assume different responsibilities in the society every eight years. It has guided the religious, social, political and economic life of Oromo for many years, and also their philosophy, art, history and method of time-keeping.

The activities and life of each and every member of the society are guided by Gadaa. It is the law of the society, a system by which Oromo administer, defend their territory and rights, maintain and guard their economy and through which all their aspirations are fulfilled.

The Gadaa system has served as the basis of democratic and egalitarian political system. Under it the power to administer the affairs of the nation and the power to make laws belong to the people. Every male member of the society who is of age and of Gadaa grade has full rights to elect and to be elected. All the people have the right to air their views in any public gathering without fear.

There follows a brief description of how the Gadaa system works: there are two well-defined ways of classifying male members of the society, that is the hiriyya (members of an age-set all born within the period of one Gadaa rule of eight years) and Gadaa grade. The Gadaa grades (stages of development through which a Gadaa class passes) differ in number (7-11) and name in different parts of Oromia although the functions are the same. The following are the Gadaa grades:-

1. Dabballee (0-8 years of age)

2. Folle or Gamme Titiqaa (8-16 years of age)

3. Qondaala or Gamme Gurgudaa (16-24 years of age)

4. Kuusa (24-32 years of age)

5. Raaba Doorii (32-40 years of age)

6. Gadaa (40-48 years of age)

7. Yuba I (48-56 years of age)

8. Yuba II (56-64 years of age)

9. Yuba III (64-72 years of age)

10. Gadamojjii (72-80 years of age)

11. Jaarsa (80 and above years of age)

We will briefly describe the duties of a Gadaa class as it passes through the above grades.

The Dabballee are sons of the Gadaa class who are in power, the Luba. They are boys up to 8 years of age. Thus this is a stage of childhood. Upon reaching their eighth year, they enter the Folle grade. At this age they are allowed to go further away from their villages and to perform light work.

At 16 years old, they enter the Qondaala. They may now go long distances to hunt and perform heavy work. Three years before the Qondaala ends, those of the Gadaa class come together and nominate the future group leaders (hayyu council) who eventually will constitute its presidium and thereby the executive, judicial and ritual authorities. The final election is preceded by an often lengthy campaign of negotiations. After nomination, the candidates tour the region accompanied by their supporters to win the backing of the people before election, The individuals will be elected on the basis of wisdom, bravery, health and physical fitness.

In the Kuusa grade, the previously elected leaders are formally installed in office, although they do not yet assume full authority except in their own group. This is one of the most important events in the life of the individual and the Gadaa system over all. In the next grade, Raaba Doorii, members are allowed to marry. This and the Kuusa grade constitute a period of preparation for the assumption of full authority. At the end of this period the class members enter Luba or Gadaa, the most important class of the whole system, attain full status, and take up their position as the ruling Gadaa class. At this stage the system comes to a stop momentarily and all men move to the proceeding class vacating the last class which is the immediately occupied by a new class of youth who thus begin their ascent of the system's ladder.

The former ruling class, the Luba, now becomes Yuba. The Yubas, after passing through three separate eight-year periods, are transferred to the Gadamojjii class. Then they enter the final grade called Jaarsa and retire completely.

As described briefly above, when the Oromo man passes from one stage to the next, his duties and way of life in society change. For instance, during the grades of Qondaala, Kuusa and Raaba Doorii, the individuals learn war tactics , Oromo history, politics, ritual, law and administration over a period of 24 years. When they enter the Gadaa class or Luba at the age of about 40 years, they have already acquired all the necessary knowledge to handle the responsibility of administering the country and the celebration of rituals. It ends with partial retirement of the whole, group of elders to an advisory and judiciary capacity.

The following are the Gadaa officials and their duties according to the Tuullama Gadaa practice:

1. Abbaa Bokku - President

2. Abbaa Bokku - First Vice-President

3. Abbaa Bokku - Second Vice-President

4. Abbaa Chaffe - Chairman of the Assembly (Chaffe)

5. Abbaa Dubbi - Speaker who presents the decision of the presidium to the Assembly

6. Abbaa Seera - Memoriser of the laws and the results of the Assembly's deliberations.

7. Abbaa Alanga - Judge who executes the decision

8. Abbaa Duula - In charge of the army

9. Abbaa Sa'a - In charge of the economy

Thus, the entire presidium consists of nine members, called ""Salgan Yaa'ii Borana"" (nine of the Borana assembly). The Abbaa Bokkus are the chief officials. (Bokku is a wooden or metal scepter, a sign of authority kept by the Abbaa Bokku, the president). The Abbaa Bokkus have counselors and assistants called Hayyus who are delegated from the lower assemblies.

There are three level of assembly - inter-clan, clan and local chaffes, chaffe being the Oromo version of parliament. The chaffe assembly was held in the open air in a meadow under the odaa (sycamore) tree. The chaffe made and declared common laws and was source of the accumulated legal knowledge and customs. In the hierarchy of Gadaa chaffes, the assembly of the entire presidium of the ruling - Gadaa Class - is the highest body whose decision is final. It is the assembly at which representatives of the entire population come together, at predetermined times, to evaluate among other things, the work of those in power. If those in power have failed to accomplish what is expected of them, the assembly has the power to replace them by another group elected from among the same Gadaa class or Luba. And this was one of the methods of checking and balancing political power in the Oromo society. The second highest Gadaa assembly is the clan chaffe. It is from these assemblies that special delegates to the higher assembly are elected. The lowest Gadaa chaffe is the local chaffe. This is made up of local members of the Luba from among whom representatives to clan chaffes are elected.

The holders of these responsible posts can remain in office for eight years only, in normal times, and are then replaced by a new group of officers. The power is handed over at a special ceremony at a special place and time. The office-holders conduct government - political, economic, social, ritual and military - affairs of the entire nation for this period. During war time all capable men fight under the leadership of the group in office. During the eight year period the officials live together in a village (yaa'aa village) and when necessary travel together.

There are five Gadaas in a cycle of 40 years. If a man enters office (becomes Luba) now, his sons will become Luba 40 years from now. The five Gadaa (sometimes called Buttaa) in the cycle have names, which vary slightly from region to region. Among some Oromo communities, the sets of five Gadaa names used by the sons are different from those of the fathers. Whereas among other communities, the same set of Gadaa names are used for both fathers and sons. For instance, the Gadaa practiced in the Borana community uses the following different sets of names for the five Gadaa. (Could be likened to five parties who take power in turns).

Fathers generation Sons generation

1. Birmajii Aldada

2. Melba Horota

3. Muudana Bifoole

4. Roobale Sabaqa

5. Duuloo Kiloolee

In this manner, a given name repeats itself every 80 years. This is in fact the complete Gadaa cycle divided into two semi-cycles of 40 years each. The first 40 years is the Gadaa of the fathers and the second is the Gadaa of the sons.

Although it is not known with any degree of certainty where and when the Gadaa system started, it is known and documented that the Oromo have been practicing it for well over 500 years. However, according to oral Oromo historians, the Gadaa system has been in practice for several centuries. ""Their (Borana Oromo) noted historian, Arero Rammata, was able to recount, in 1969, an oral history covering four thousand years"", (Prouty et al, 1981). Today Gadaa experts easily recall fifty-seven Abbaa Gadaas with important events. Of course, this highly sophisticated system cannot have appeared without having been based on something earlier. Therefore, further study and analysis is required to know more about its origin and development.

Social scientists of diverse backgrounds at different times have studied the Gadaa system. Many of them have testified that it is uniquely democratic. Among those authorities, Plowden (1868), stated, ""among republican systems, Gadaa is superior."" Asmarom Legesse (1973) described the Gadaa system: ""one of the most astonishing and instructive turns the evolution of human society has taken."" Indeed, it is one of the most fascinating sociopolitical structure of Africa that even influenced the lives of other peoples. Several neighboring peoples have practiced a sort of the Gadaa. Among these are Sidama, Walayita, Konso, Darasa, Nyika, Nabdi, Maasai, etc., (Beckingham et al, 1954).

Like living organism, cultures undergo evolution in order to adapt to changing conditions. The Gadaa system has thus been undergoing evolutionary changes since its inception so as to serve better a continually developing society. However, the fundamental that occurred in the Gadaa system, starting around the end of the eighteenth century, were brought about mainly by events set in motion from outside the Oromo society. Therefore, it was not fully a normal or natural development.

In most communities suddenly and in a few cases gradually, the usefulness of the Gadaa system declined. Among the factors that had contributed to this decline were: firstly, the protracted wars that preceded the onset of colonization. The end of the eighteenth century was marked by constant wars and skirmishes, particularly in the north and north-eastern Oromia against the encroachment of the Abyssinians. Because of the insecurity imposed by such wars coupled with the distances involved to go to the Gadaa ceremonies to change the leadership, the Abbaa Duulas (fathers of war) stayed on their post for much longer period than required by the Gadaa rules. This gave these war leaders a mandatory power, because they were forced or encouraged by the society and existing circumstances, such as the continuous wars, to hang on to power. This weakened one of the outstanding features of the Gadaa system, the built-in checks and balances mechanism of political power. This in turn weakened the ideology by which the Oromo nation was successfully led for several centuries.

In addition to the protracted wars, the passing of major trade routes through the area and the subsequent expansion of trade gained the war leaders more wealth. Thus the wealth, fame and power they gradually gained enabled them to command a larger number of followers in the area they were defending. Thus they usurped the political power that belonged to the Gadaa officials and the people and finally some of them declared themselves ""mootii"" (kings).

The second important factor that contributed to this decline was the coming of new beliefs and religions. The politico-religious aggression that took place in the expansion of Islam and Christianity has affected the culture of the Oromo people very much. The invasion of Oromo land by Muslims in the east and south and by Christians in the north have left their mark on the Oromo culture.

Thirdly, the changes in the mode of living of several Oromo communities was probably one of the important factors that led to the decline of Gadaa. As the Oromo society developed, there was a gradual change in the social, economic and political life of the people. For instance, in many parts of Oromia, a settled agrarian mode of life developed fast and the people practiced both mixed agriculture - raised crops and animals - and nomadic pastoralism. The latter was the dominant mode of life before this time, although Oromo have practiced cultivation for a long time and have made significant contribution to agriculture by domesticating plants and rearing rare varieties of crop plants. The introduction and expansion of trade had significant contribution also. These and other related factors led to the emergence of a new social system, which created a significant pressure on the Gadaa system and brought about a modification or change in the Gadaa practices.

Finally, the onset of colonization had tremendously reduced the political and usefulness of Gadaa system as the administrative affairs and management of the national economy were taken over by the colonizers except in remote regions. Atseme noted, ""Menilek outlawed the major chaffe meetings in the Oromo areas he conquered."" Bartels (1983) also noted, ""Gadaa ... was gradually deprived by Amharas of most of its political and judicial powers and reduced to merely ritual institution."" Even the social aspects, that is the ritual and ceremonial aspects, have not been left to the people. The observance of Gadaa ceremonies has been prohibited by proclamation.

The Oromo people also have a rich folklore, oral tradition, music and art. For example, it is believed that the Oromo are responsible for the invention and use of phallic stones (Wainwright, 1949 and Greenfield, 1965). Decorations of stone bowls from Zimbabwe include pictures of cattle with long ""lyre-shaped"" horns such as raised by Oromo. According to these scholars, this and the phallic stones found in Zimbabwe are traced directly to Oromo and linked to their early settlements there and to the Zimbabwe civilization. Wainwright (1949) argued that these were founded by the Oromo. He wrote: ""Waqlimi and his people came from Galla land and its neighborhood, and were already installed in southern Rhodesia before A.D. 900."" (Waqlimi is an Oromo name). This date coincides with the date of the erection of some of the famous buildings there which Wainwright says were built by ""Galla."" This appears to be part of the spread of Cushitic civilization.

Although much of this culture and these traditions have survived harsh suppression, much has been forgotten and lost, artifacts have been destroyed and Oromo are discouraged from developing their culture and art.",[],2025-10-15 19:14:26
1mw7zo8,Our season of autumn 🇿🇦,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mw7zo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1mw7zo8/our_season_of_autumn/,Disastrous_Macaron34,Africa,2025-08-21 13:13:34,364,20,1.0,"South Africa experiences four distinct seasons which are in the order of summer, autumn, spring and winter - following a conventional pattern in the southern hemisphere. The season of autumn typically spans from the months of March to May, and the weather transitions from warm summer days to cooler evenings with fresh mornings. 

As the scorching summer days mellow into crisp mornings and golden afternoons, South Africa welcomes one of its most precious natures — the russet, amber, and copper essence of autumn. The blend of dusky sunsets, a subtle scent of pine with woodsmoke, and a gentle mist weaving through the foliage of maple leaves creates a uniquely rustic wonder. The beauty would tenderly seep into the scenic landscape of the Midlands with a rustling carpet of fallen leaves from a canopy of oak trees and enhanced by a delicate fragrance of the damp earth. In a remarkable sight, the atmosphere of Johannesburg is surrounded with a palette of auburn, crimson, brown and orange in the retreat of a botanical garden alongside the fiery highveld of the Emmarentia suburb. The display is further neatly tucked within green wheat lines and a golden column of poplar blooms that stand at the foot of towering Maluti mountains in the stunning escape of Clarens. The pleasure of immersing yourself in the path of russet-toned dry grasses and flame-coloured woodlands would lead into a long trail of grapevines with rows that stretch a special wine tasting sanctuary across the glowing horizons of Stellenbosch and Franschhoek. The mounting of monumental bronze mask sculpture*s* by Anton Smit filter through lush greenery throughout many parts of the country and furnished with varying artistic emotions.

One of the interesting facts is that the abundance of flora represents a significant period of harvesting in which many crops have reached maturity and prepared for gathering. The indigenous delight of *rooibos* tea (attached in the last photo) is no exception to nature as autumn would mark the harvest season in a quaint town tucked away at the foot of the majestic Cederberg mountains and the only place in the world where *rooibos* grows. Rooibos tea, also known as ""red bush tea"", is a caffeine-free herbal infusion made from the leaves of the *aspalathus linearis* shrub that is native to South Africa. Unlike traditional black or green tea, the household comfort of *rooibos* is a herbal tea or tisane with a naturally slightly earthy flavour and a reddish-brown colour. It is set apart for being low in tannins and rich in antioxidants - offering potential health benefits like improved heart health and blood sugar regulation. Cederberg has much to offer guests by way of the ‘Rooibos Route’ where people can learn how *rooibos* moves from farm to cup while exploring the unique sights and sounds of the beautiful region. A few hours of distance from Cape Town, the area offers an adventure of unwinding with hiking or even backpacking trips and sightseeing of ancient landmarks. 

However, much like trees shedding their leaves, autumn is also a time for symbolic reflection and letting go of what is no longer needed. The wilderness evokes a novel sense of clarity where truly our moods change like the weather due to a warm introspection of embracing new beginnings and cleansing old habits. The season of autumn would regularly present a note that is quieter than summer, a texture that is softer than spring, and a hue that is richer than winter.

Nights and weekends I run beef cattle and also grow wheat , beans , or hay. 

I tend to like the farming because it can be so quantitative, though it is more time consuming. Soil tests , tissue tests, rain measurements, Fertilizer application rate. Etc. I can sort of calculate what I expect to make and if I run short or long due to lack of nutrients or something, I can identify that as a cause, account for its risk, develop improvement plan etc.

The cattle I have a harder time, although it is easier for me to do as a “night job”. I can try to get better quality hay, spray my pastures, rotate pastures, etc. but I seem to have a hard time measuring the results of these activities. I can obviously look at the pasture and see that the spraying helped, but like for cattle I don’t have a reliable way to “measure” the impact on their health or weight gain or meat quality (I just sell calves and don’t hold stickers). Sometimes I look at a cow that is a bag of bones that I feel like needs to go to slaughter and she produces the best calf I have, and vice versa, I can pamper my cows and they create little runts. Maybe it’s something with genetics I am missing? 

I don’t know what I am asking for but maybe just brainstorm ideas to help me think about the cattle operation. In my line of work we typically say you can’t improve something if you can’t measure it. And I really don’t know how to best measure the health and performance of my cattle. Even if I just take the weight of the entire calf crop, there is so much variation from just year to year on their size due to birth timing, death loss, etc. I don’t know where to focus my efforts in order to improve. Any ideas? I thought about tracking the individual weight of each calf paired to each cow over years to see which are best producing, but I’ve never know anyone to weigh individual calves.

This period has witnessed a profound transformation in various domains of agricultural science and practice, driven by advancements in genomics, precision agriculture, agroecology, biotechnology, and digital innovation. These developments have collectively propelled agriculture towards enhanced productivity, resource efficiency, environmental stewardship, and global food security.

Genomic advancements have engendered a paradigm shift in crop breeding and improvement. High-throughput sequencing technologies, coupled with bioinformatics tools, have expedited the identification and manipulation of key genetic traits governing yield, disease resistance, and stress tolerance. The advent of genome editing techniques, particularly CRISPR-Cas9, has facilitated precise and targeted genetic modifications, enabling the creation of novel crop varieties with enhanced traits, while mitigating the controversy associated with transgenic approaches.

Precision agriculture has emerged as a pivotal strategy for optimizing resource allocation and crop management. Integration of remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has enabled real-time monitoring of field conditions, pest outbreaks, and nutrient levels. Data-driven decision support systems have empowered farmers to tailor interventions with unprecedented accuracy, minimizing input wastage, reducing environmental impact, and augmenting yield.

Agroecology has gained traction as a holistic and sustainable approach to farming. Fostering synergistic interactions between ecological processes and agricultural systems, agroecology promotes biodiversity, soil health, and ecosystem resilience. Incorporation of cover crops, crop rotation, and intercropping practices has enriched soil organic matter, curtailed erosion, and curbed reliance on chemical inputs. This systems-oriented approach prioritizes resilience and adaptability in the face of climate variability and changing pest dynamics.

Biotechnology has experienced notable progress, characterized by novel biopesticides, biofertilizers, and biofortified crops. Harnessing the potential of beneficial microorganisms and naturally occurring compounds, these bioproducts offer sustainable alternatives to conventional agrochemicals, curtailing environmental contamination and reducing ecological imbalances. Additionally, biofortification initiatives have yielded crops with enhanced nutritional profiles, addressing malnutrition and enhancing food security, particularly in vulnerable populations.

Digital innovation has revolutionized agricultural management through platforms like farm management software, predictive analytics, and blockchain technology. These tools facilitate data integration, supply chain traceability, and market access, enhancing transparency and accountability. Blockchain, in particular, has the potential to curb fraud and ensure fair compensation, particularly in complex global value chains.

These developments have collectively driven the trajectory of agriculture towards increased productivity, reduced environmental impact, and improved global food security, underscoring the significance of interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in shaping the state of the art in agriculture.","['agroecology', 'food security']",2025-10-15 19:14:29

**BIO BUZZ:**

💪🏾 Nestlé debuts its first animal-free protein powder, with 21g of protein per serving and 10x more sustainable than whey protein from cows

🍼 Yali Bio has created the ‘world's first’ breast milk fat from yeast, using precision fermentation to closely match the nutrition of human milk

🥛 Remilk becomes the first company to have its animal-free milk protein greenlit for use in Canada 

👨‍🍳 Algae Cooking Club introduces a chef-grade microalgae-based cooking oil with high sustainability credentials and health benefits

🥚 Ivy Farm Technologies partnered with Fortnum & Mason to develop the world's first scotch egg containing cultivated meat

🐶 Bond Pet Foods shipped 2 metric tons of animal protein produced via fermentation to Hill’s Pet Nutrition

🐮 ProFuse Technology launches a non-GMO bovine cell line enabling indefinite cell division for cultivated meat production

🍔 Impossible Foods partners with the US Army Central to introduce plant-based meat products in military dining facilities overseas

🍅 First genetically modified food crop becomes available to home gardeners in the US

**MACRO STUFF:**

🇪🇺 European Commission said that Italy violated EU procedures by banning cultivated meat without consulting the Commission

🌏 New report explores the behaviours and attitudes of consumers in Southeast Asia regarding plant-based meat

🇬🇧 New interdisciplinary study in the UK will examine the impact of cultivated meat on society

🤔 The FDA is about to undergo a major reorganisation. What does it mean for alt protein regulation?

**BIO BUCKS:**

🇺🇸 US Department of Defense launched an investment program to promote biotech to advance national and economic security

🇺🇸 US Department of Energy announced an $83M funding opportunity to reduce emissions, with a focus on the alternative protein industry

🇳🇱 The Future Food Fund II raised €40M to invest in agricultural and food tech startups with a focus on ecological impact

📉 Cultivated meat funding declined 78% in 2023, according to preliminary AgFunder data

I joined a gym solely for the purpose of gaining muscle. This is a privately owned gym which does all forms of training. On the first day, the owner and operator who is also a trainer, talked to me. **BEFORE** he asked me what I eat, have any allergies or what my eating regimen was, he gave me a run down of things to **completely** get rid of in my diet. I thought it was pretty strange, because, other than sugar, I have never heard any of the other claims. Then he emailed me that information so I can reference it. I talked to my family doctor - who knows my health very well - and she said his nutrition guide sounded like alarmist bullshit. 

He says in order to gain muscle, you have to get rid of Soy, Dairy, Sugar, Gluten and Corn. 

Why? Because it makes your muscles inflamed. And inflamed muscles slow your gains progress. That was the jist of it. 

[Here's the graphics that he sent me](https://imgur.com/a/8khKgbT). It tells you why those ingredients make your muscles inflamed. 

For your information, I have zero dietary allergies. 

Thoughts? 

Thank you for Reading

EDIT: Wow, this blew up really high! I didn't expect the turnout. I really appreciate everyone's insights, whether it was pro or against this guide. Thank you very much for commenting and replying. I have made up my mind though - I should continue going my own way without listening to this advice. I don't have any known dietary allergies or diseases and none of the mentioned food categories make me feel sick in any way (except sugar. Sugar sucks). I initially thought it was not useful to add them, but there are more stuff to those infographics that I will link , which also adds sugar. And for your information, like many suspected, NONE of them had any citations or resources linked. [More of the infographic](https://imgur.com/a/PgKeTqZ)",[],2025-10-15 19:14:32

What disability-friendly work is out there?


I'm stressing out over the effect my health will have on my career. I'm a chronic overachiever, performing at the top of my course and about to finish my Honour's year with a Sydney Accord qualification in Eng Tech and unweighted GPA ~8.2. My health has been failing pretty quick over this time. I'm 23 with degenerating joints +arthritis, a pending foot reconstruction and losing strength/feeling in my arms and legs. My specialists are trying to figure it out but it's looking likely that my limbs will continue to get worse. There are no cures, just surgeries and meds for the symptoms. Walking and sitting are painful and I have to carefully manage my activity levels. 

As is tradition for a soon-to-be graduate, I'm stressed about career pathways, with an unhealthy sprinking of health-related fear. I've reached out to career and disability services in the past but they all know very little about this industry. The head of school at my uni has constantly questioned my suitability for this work when I ask for accommodations. I've hidden what I can about my health at internships for the most part - my disabilities are currently only visible if you have a good understanding of the related genetic deformities. I will gradually need my mobility aids more consistently. 

The thing is, I love food tech and I'm quite good at it. Formulation is a breeze but I'd really love to work in novel ingredient/crop development. There are some soon-to-be lucrative opportunities in my country and I have formed the connections and skills to contribute meaningful work. I just don't know how long I can keep doing physical work and what else is out there for me. 

I'm probably going to go for a PhD scholarship to compensate for my lack of physical abilities but I don't know if that will just leave me in the same position career-wise but further along the disability train. I would assume that working in industry would be ruled out, given that mobility aids are difficult to sterilise for controlled areas? Wouldn't labs also be discounted for similar reasons? What else could I do and how accommodating are employers?",[],2025-10-15 19:14:32

Hi I’m an average guy who woke up an activist on November 9th and found this march:

 Tell EVERYBODY. Game on, April 29, 2017.

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/). 

Lets tell our representatives we want to **stay in the Paris Agreement!** If they don't, they'll see we're organized and will vote them out!

10 million strong, seriously. Aim high. ACT LIKE CHAMPIONS! LET'S DO THIS! And then at least feel like we've tried and done something historic, ya know? 
________

**Edit:**

To address concerns in the comments: **pledge to lower your CO2 spent to get to the march.** This sends a good signal, such as: train = if you can take a train. car = carpool. bus = rally bus. airplane = carbon offset (plant 25 trees per person). **Other ideas?** Especially for those who'd have to fly?

Let’s take an extreme scenario where a many people fly all the way across the country. That would cost at most in hundreds of thousands of metric tons of CO2 emissions. [carbon calculator](http://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3) 

Staying in the Paris Agreement **reduces carbon emissions by BILLIONS of metric tons and puts us on a sustainable course for good.**

The top grey dotted line in [this info graphic](http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/US-emissions-chart.jpg) is if the Paris Agreement with American participation doesn’t happen. Game over.

_________

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/) are the same folks that organized the biggest climate march to date in 2014 with hundreds of thousands. Now they’re at it again, on April 29th 2017 right before Trump's 100 days.

Are there other groups that combine environmental organizations that you know of? If so, who? Get them to join this march! 

Are there other marches scheduled that others don't know of yet? How can we combine them into one massive showing?

I think his election is scaring many of us (myself being an example) into activism mode, rather than assuming our gov is taking care of the problem (like the Paris global initiative Obama put together that Trump threatens to dismantle).

___________________
INVITE EVERYONE WHO ALREADY CARES

Peoplesclimate.org is a combo of dozens of organizations, including 350.org, as seen at bottom of page. Let's help them add even more to the list. 

**Invite Bernie** and his millions on board, all democrats and more Environmental Organizations.

Invite DiCaprio who made the powerful documentary Before the Flood, and has millions of twitter followers. 

And other passionate media folks and celebrities who can reach the masses. If you happen to know any, invite them!

And the Clintons, and Gore. If this is really about the preservation of our planet, it's wake up time.

Reach out to younger people in their 20s and even High School, who will inherit this planet. 

Reach to all environmental organizations and get them to join this march, like The Sierra Club and … ?

How about religious organizations? Even the POPE spoke out recently!!! This involves ALL OF US. This is something we can all agree and come together on!

__________
REACHING OUT TO MODERATE CONSERVATIVES

I've actually seen on reddit that moderate conservatives, many who voted Trump, still believe in climate change. I think we should make it a CENTRIST issue. Take out the political charge, and base it in stewards of our earth and country. Reach across the divide, why not? Have some real conversations based in fact. Know the economic concerns of those who push back against regulation and acknowledge them, and support them in adapting.

Recent reddit comments brought up the fact that if sea level rise doesn't scare em into action, which may not matter as much to those inland as it does on the coast, then reframe it to the impact of stronger storms and tornados, and droughts on crop production. And overall the impact on our economy if the coastal cities and towns are under water.

We need republican support in congress to move the needle. and if not, then they need to be afraid of getting reelected.

This fella is trying, for example: [Jay Faison's Quest to Save the Planet (And the GOP)](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-01/jay-faison-s-expensive-maddening-quest-to-save-the-planet-and-the-gop)

______________
MASSIVE MOVEMENT BRINGS EDUCATION AND ACTION

10 million people marching. I'm not even kidding. 20 million Muslims just marched in Iraq against ISIS. 2 million marched in South Korea against their president. If they all can organize in face of a dire threat, so can we.

In addition to marching, just organizing into a mass movement can spread actionable ideas. Educating people on the low hanging fruit, the easier first steps towards reducing emissions in our day to day choices. 

If millions organize and speak with our votes and dollars ... support green initiatives and companies, then we fight through governmental and capitalist methods. 

The carbon tax for example is the biggest government move. We need to educate ourselves on a deeper level on the real issue(s), like the pros/cons of the carbon tax. I understand it could hurt business profit, which is the reason for so much push back. And that we're taking on more of the burden as part of the Paris Accord then the rest of the world, is another push back I've read. We need intelligent answers to these issues. 

And Climate Denial? The Pentagon and NASA have published proof of our impact on Climate Change. We need to counter the vocal deniers.  But we already have the numbers for massive action. There’s a reason why Obama was able to align 197 countries in the Paris Agreement.

We fixed the ozone layer, we've increased fuel efficiency, and safety. We can do this heavy lift, even if it imposes on profit, if it's necessary to support life on freaking earth!

And social media is how Trump won, we can wield it too. It's an insanely powerful force for any movement when the communication is solid.



**TLDR:
There's a major march to stay in the Paris Agreement and combat Climate Change. It's in D.C. on April 29, 2017. [Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/). This is our chance, please come! And link other organizations so we can build one massive movement and make this issue CENTRIST and CENTRAL to our government and all Americans.**",[],2025-10-15 19:14:36

I'm a biologist in formation, almost finishing my graduation (pretty hard tho) and I thought I wanted to work with environmental biotech, so I'm doing a scientific project in this area and I'm trying do discover a fungi that can degradete glyphosate and 2,4-D (the most common and toxic herbicides in the world). 

But I'm finding myself totally desperate and with no hope at all! Did you guys read the IPCC report on climate change? I started to read the all book but I stopped, it was taking me to a place that I don't really wanna go. 
Basically it looks like there's nothing we can do, only wait for the horrible death with extreme heat and lack of water and food. There's people in the world already living those bad situations... My point here is that the apocalypse is already at the door and we gonna live it. 

So, why would I loose many parts of my life, loose my sanity, loose my great health condition just to do a PhD that no one is going to read, that will change nothing (if there's something to change, bc as I saw on the news IPCC brought to us, there's really nothing we can do), when the world is literally on fire and my life is ending? 
Why would I keep trying? People don't care about. When I talk about how we're f*cked up, people look at me and say that I am crazy or pessimistic. 

Everytime I ask about this for people they tell me things like: but if you do a little, you already did! That's what counts! 

But, really..... Does it make sense to loose all the things I know I would loose to make just a little thing when I know that there's a lot of people suffering from climate change effects, dying, crying, screaming for help? Is like putting a drop on a huge fire... 

Anyways, I'm lost, I wanna give up from everything, I'm tired of seeing the wonderful things in this planet going dead just to keep some 100 dudes rich. But I don't wanna k*ll myself so I need some hope, I need to give a meaning to my life dream again (I dream about being a scientist since I was 5 years old) and that's why I'm here for. 

What do you think about it? What do you think that we, the researchers, should be asking for? How to live in a mad max world? How to support heat and lack of food? How to crop stuff in an complete destroyed environment? 

I really don't know, want some opinions.

MARCH 30 - 

*General:*

* Coronavirus death rate is lower than previously reported, study says, but it's still deadlier than seasonal flu. The research, published in the medical journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, estimated that about 0.66% of those infected with the virus will die. That coronavirus death rate, which is lower than earlier estimates, takes into account potentially milder cases that often go undiagnosed -- but it's still far higher than the 0.1% of people who are killed by the flu. When undetected infections aren't taken into account, the Lancet study found that the coronavirus death rate was 1.38%, which is more consistent with earlier reports.

*Updates from around the world:*

* Portugal has temporarily given all migrants and asylum seekers full citizenship rights, granting them full access to the country's healthcare as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus escalates in the country.

* Netherlands: In a national address to the Dutch nation on Monday, March 16th, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said his country would aim to develop immunity to the novel coronavirus among its population by allowing large numbers to contract the illness at a controlled pace. In the past week, Rutte has since walked back the herd immunity policy line by introducing what could be characterized as lockdown light.
