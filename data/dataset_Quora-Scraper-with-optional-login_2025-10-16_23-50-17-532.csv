"27","Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.  If you want to make a change, do it with your wallet.Also, please keep in mind that most GMO crops are grown as feed for livestock.  So you must keep meat and dairy choices in mind when shopping, as well.","2014-12-26T18:52:46.940Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyOTczOTg2","3","2973986","For those who support GMO, can anyone explain why people should choose GMO over non-GMO foods?","https://www.quora.com/For-those-who-support-GMO-can-anyone-explain-why-people-should-choose-GMO-over-non-GMO-foods"
"26","You can take this question in one of two ways.  If you want to answer the question \proactively label their GMO-containing foods?\Justin Ma has a great answer.  I take the question to mean \regulations that require them to label food that contains GMO-derived ingredients?\I will focus on the United States, since that is where I am most familiar with the regulatory environment. Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do. Basically, the people who just claim that mandatory labeling laws would just \For those who insist on providing information to consumers, there is a way you can do this: label your own products the way you want, and don't force others to do so.

"16","Genetically Modified Organism. However what that means can be one of contention and you really need to ask who you are talking to. In many debates they are talking about intergenus genetic modification (of any process) especially those like Bt-Ready and Roundup-Ready. The anti-GMO debates tend to be mostly anti-Monsanto and focus on those types of modification.Some labeling laws have limited their scope to just this as well. Vermont's H.112 (Page on State) defines it as \The organic standard is a bit more direct: \Excluded methods. A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production. Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macroencapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology). Such methods do not include the use of traditional breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture.\Code of Federal Regulations)Some researchers are trying to separate the terms and use other terms for what they do depending on whether they are doing their breeding outside taxonomic group or not. There are also some trying to argue the organic standard should take the difference in public opinion (breeding vs anti-monsanto) into account (see Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics, and the Future of Food: Pamela C.

"62","The same exact reason people are opposed to lab-grown diamonds: because an industry that makes immense profits from “organic” food has spent billions of dollars waging an immense propaganda campaign to whip people who don’t know how to do their research into a frenzy targeted at their business rivals.You even see some of that propaganda being repeated right here in the answers to this question, by people who sincerely believe whatever they’re told they’re saying.There’s a great example of this right here in this answer thread, by Tomaž Vargazon. I’m not picking on him; I generally find his content well-written and well-researched. But in this case, his answer is filled with misinformation and urban legend.For example, a common urban legend is that Monsanto sued farmers for accidental contamination, pursuing anyone with even a few stray plants in their fields so aggressively they bankrupted them.This story was invented by one man, a farmer in Indiana named Vernon Hugh Bowman. He collected soybean seeds from a grain elevator, planted them, then sprayed them with glyphosate to kill the ones that were not GM. He then planted his entire field with them.He tried claiming “accidental contamination” when he was sued, spinning a yarn that not even a jury of his peers believed. (Hint, when more than 95% of the plants on your farm are the same strain, that’s no accident, LOL.) He was convicted by a jury of his peers, but the story he spun stuck.I used to believe this story myself, just like Tomaž. Then someone challenged me to the same challenge I am about to make to Tomaž, and anyone else weho believes it:Name the farmers sued for this.All court cases in the US are public. If this happened, there should be plenty of examples. Cite cases. Name someone. You won’t be able to do it.In fact, Monsanto sent out people free of charge to clean out accidental contamination from any farmer who reported it.As for the “dangers” of glyphosate:Moreover, the company hid internal studies that showed their key moneymaking herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) wasn’t as safe as advertised. It was linked to an increase of cancer risk with gross overexposure.No.The overall incidence of cancer amongst people exposed to glyphosate is lower (yes, seriously!) than baseline.Lower. Not higher. Yes, seriously.The UN “study” that listed glyphosate as a “suspected carcinogen” is widely ridiculed in medical and scientific communities.So, why does this happen?$$$ money $$$Whenever you have a huge amount of money on the line, you will have a huge amount of money available for propaganda.People like to say Monsanto was this huge megacorporation. Actually, no, when it existed, it was kind of a pipsqueak.Organic foods, on the other hand, are an immense, fat-profit business. Sales of organic foods are more than triple Monsanto’s revenues.Organic food is huge, with much fatter profits than conventional or GM food, and organic food makers have poured billions of dollars over the yearsinto anti-GM propaganda—propaganda that well-meaning, otherwise intelligent people accept because it matches their bisaes and fears.I come to this from the position of a person who once believed as Tomaž and others do: Monsanto was an evil giant megacorporation, GM companies patented foods and that was bad, they bullied small farmers, and so on and so on.I started questioning that narrative when I started asking specific questions:How big is the GM food industry? How big is the organic food industry? Which is bigger?What farmers did Monsanto bully, specifically? What were their names? What were the case numbers? What farmers “lost their farms” because of Monsanto? Who were they?If GM food is bad because of food patents, then why did the first food patents get issued in the 1800s, before genetic engineering was a thing? Why are organic foods patented? (Spoilter: Yes, organic and conventional foods are also patented! Surprise! It’s amazing how many people legitimately don’t know this.)Once you start down these rabbit holes, you end up in a very different place than you started from.Why are so many people opposed to GM food? Because people are fearful about food in general, people have a purity fetish around food, and a lot of extremely profitable corporations spend a ton of money to make people frightened of GM food.Add in anti-corporate narratives and it becomes an easy sell.","2013-11-07T22:36:18.877Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxNDI0OTkx","6","1424991","Why are so many people opposed to genetically modified food?","https://www.quora.com/Why-are-so-many-people-opposed-to-genetically-modified-food"
"55","No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.","2014-08-04T14:38:10.138Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyMjU0MTYx","7","2254161","Are genetically modified foods harmful to human health in the long run?","https://www.quora.com/Are-genetically-modified-foods-harmful-to-human-health-in-the-long-run"
"28","Well, it is a topic on which a long debate could be done on.As being a biotechnologist (pursing undergraduate course in biotech), my views are as follows:A variety of GM crops are being harvested in various parts of the world and many are still being worked on. The best part of GM crops is their high yield, good nutritional quality, a good shelf life, could be harvested in lesser time than the normal ones and the point of my interest- could be used to make edible vaccines (would'nt it be great- nutrition and vaccination all in a single shot- could be quite handy for poor countries and UN). Now on to the GM organisms. Till now, I have not known to any GMO. But I still know that they are being worked on. Their best use could be for MOLECULAR PHARMING (i.e obtaining vaccines and other biological agents like insulin from animal milk or any other by-product). Their are many GM Microorganisms, which are being used industrially in breweries and other pharmaceutical or I should say neutraceutical (nutritional + pharmaceutical) companies, and have revolutionized this sector.But the cons are bio-ethics.

"49","Music.Music is what happens when a song is played -- either a performance or a recording of a performance. Music cannot be separated from the experience of listening to it in a way that can be owned.Recordings aren't even owned. They are licensed to you for limited uses by the copyright holders, in most cases, it'd the record label the artist has signed over their rights to.What we think of as the recordings we own on digital file, CD, phonograph, cassette, 8-track, or whatever -- these are merely containers for the recordings. We own the containers, but we do not own the recordings contained within them.It all boils down to this: what we think of as ownership of music is actually us paying for the right to access the music. In a world where the technological cost of providing global access to the entire history of recorded music is easily covered by charging a small fee or tax for access, the idea of music ownership will and should be considered anachronistic. Music is free. What we pay for is access.Of course, musicians need some sort of fair compensation to stimulate the production of music. This is the purpose of copyright in the first place. But musicians have never been fairly compensated for their music. Over the last few centuries, a microscopic minority of musicians became wealthy, while the music industry itself grew to a multibillion dollar enterprise. Increasingly, copyright is used by corporations to stifle technological innovation the maintain the status quo of musician exploitation and the lie of musical ownership. Prior to the invention of the recording, music could only be generated through a performance. There had to be musicians playing within earshot in order for one to experience music. Or, you had to play the song yourself. The economics were simple -- musicians enjoyed the support of their patrons, and later, the public became patron as live music flourished. The recording -- and the concept of music ownership -- shut down much of this burgeoning live music scene. The great irony is that after the recording dominated 20th century music, the 21st century brought the disruption of digital distribution, causing us to give new value the live performance and viewing the recording for what it really is -- a facsimile of a single performance. As such, we have a new generation of listeners and musicians that recognize music ownership is a capitalist illusion, access to music should be free like tap water (which we perceive as free but in reality is paid for as a utility), and live performance should be held up as the ultimate authentic music experience. This is why the concert industry is booming and record sales are plummeting.","2013-03-18T21:27:06.892Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxMDMzMTg3","10","1033187","What are things people think they own, but they actually don't (e.g. a mortgaged home, software, GMO seeds)?","https://www.quora.com/What-are-things-people-think-they-own-but-they-actually-dont-e-g-a-mortgaged-home-software-GMO-seeds"

This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is! And how/what’s that? We take the gene, that acts like a blueprint on how to make this hormone, from a healthy person. We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin. Soon, you have thousands of bacteria producing this hormone, and the quantity and quality of this insulin is good enough to become an economically viable manufacturing process, and that’s how you get insulin these days.So who was the GMO here? It was the bacteria. You manipulated the genetic material of the bacteria, so that it produced more insulin, which was for your own benefit, and made medicine cheaper.By the way, which kind of egg do you have?","2016-01-27T16:35:36.742Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo2NzMyNzY1","12","6732765","What is a genetically modified organism (GMO)?","https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-genetically-modified-organism-GMO"

"28","I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control.

Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day. That is pretty sad.","2015-10-23T10:49:07.575Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1NjUwNjQz","15","5650643","Is there evidence that GMO foods are bad for you?","https://www.quora.com/Is-there-evidence-that-GMO-foods-are-bad-for-you-1"
"17","Neither in my opinion. Is the farmer a knowledgeable and honest grower? That’s the question of importance.Organic means that it has been grown without the application of synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. However, this does not prohibit the farmer from applying natural pesticides (pyrethrines) at high concentrations too close to harvest or applying manure from animals that were given high doses of antibiotics.The responsibility of what is good or not lies with the farmer. Not the product.If you follow the instructions of how to properly grow a crop from an agronomist it does not matter, which method or seed you use; organic or conventional farming, non-gmo or gmo. There are no nutritional differences measured from either type of crop cultivation. Flavor-wise it is better to buy from a farmer’s market than a supermarket, where they harvest immature vegetables and fruits, but nutritionally they are almost identical as well.Non-GMOs means that the product has been produced through traditional breeding methods which is a very long procedure (10–15 years). GMOs could have a disease resistance or drought resistance gene inside them from a related species or not, etc. This has absolutely no effect on you, unless we are talking about a toxin introduced into the plant, which companies avoid anyway doing that. Companies do not want dead or ill consumers. They want hungry and healthy consumers to keep buying their products. Period.So, to answer your question:I would consider more important Organic vs non-organic, although there is no practical difference between them for you. I just expect that Organic farmers would be more diligent as small-scale farmers about their concern for your food. GMOs vs non-GMOs just does not matter.Personally I would choose the farmer first and then my products.","2018-11-11T02:35:12.378Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDozNzIyOTY5Ng==","16","37229696","What’s more important: organic or non-gmo?","https://www.quora.com/What-s-more-important-organic-or-non-gmo"
"13","I have trouble with the terminology, but the concepts are clear.GMO, or genetically modified organisms, are the essence of agriculture. For thousands of years, farmers, agronomists, plant scientists have used plant and animal breeding to manipulate the genetic makeup of the foods we eat. That is a good thing.However, GMOs as they are developed today, uses recombinant DNA manipulation to alter the attributes of the plants. As a result, it is possible to introduce changes that we would never see in nature (i.e. introduction of animal characteristics into plant material). While that’s not necessarily bad, we also greatly reduce the time it takes to see the changes in the material, and therefore we can’t fully investigate the unintended consequences of our manipulations. Every technological innovation has risks of unintended consequences, but genetic manipulation can have broad, catastrophic impacts. It’s kind of like nuclear power generation: it’s a great thing when everything is fine, and failure may be very rare, but the impacts can be huge. I advocate continuing research, but proceeding slowly. I also believe in detailed labelling to enable consumers to make their own choices.Organic foods fall into a different category. The term “organic” is meaningless and requires significant explanation in order to be useful for consumers. I do not believe that inorganic fertilizers are “bad” and I do not believe that all herbicides and pesticides are bad. Again, it’s a matter of really looking into the specific practices of cultivation. That’s one reason why I do agree with buying from local producers: the consumer has the ability to find out exactly how something was produced and to talk to the producer.","2016-03-25T20:32:50.899Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo3NDkyODY5","17","7492869","What is your opinion of GMO and organic foods?","https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-of-GMO-and-organic-foods"

Soybeans. Cotton. Canola ( rapeseed). Alfalfa. There's more, but these will do fine for what we are talking about.\n \nNow we need to separate the crops into 2 subsets. Those crops that are self pollinated and those that are outcrossers. Selfers are plants that pollinate themselves by having the pollen drop into the stigma of the flower without needing outside help, like an insect or the wind, thus ensuring a tomato, or a chile pepper, or a wheat kernel. \n \n \nOutcrossers need help to spread pollen. That head of broccoli needed mostly bees to help create it, or that ear of corn needed some strong wind to spread pollen.\n \nOk. So. Selfers- Soybeans. Cotton. \n \nOutcrossers.- Corn. Canola. Alfalfa. \n \nCrops that are selfers don't suffer from inbreeding depression, a term that means they lose their viability over time from having too little genetic diversity during the growing season. So saving seed from one tomato plant, one wheat plant, one bean plant is fine. That seed can be grown and resaved for a lifetime.\n \nOutcrossers aren't like that. They need lot's of genetic diversity, which to the farmer means they  grow a lot of plants. One broccoli plant? No way. One carrot plant, one corn plant, one canola plant? No. Think at least 500 to start, and no less than 100 to finish. They need pollination from a large population of plants. Without this, the seed is very poor, genetically bottlenecked and usually unfit for next generational use. \n \nOk?\n \nNow let's further separate these crops into 2 types.

GMO's are just as nutritious as non-GMO's (except when they are designed to be even more nutritious, like Golden Rice) and cause no health problems. Here is a literature review of these results, and another assessment of GE food safety here.Note that studies do exist saying GMO's are bad… but you asked for good ones. Studies existed saying vaccines cause autism and that cigarettes are harmless, but those studies were flawed and a few were retracted. It is important to 1) not let a single study trump the dozens of studies that contradict it, 2) not confuse opinion papers with actual science research, and 3) be sure that any study has valid controls, a large sample size, no conflict of interest (be it big-Agritech or big-Organic, both of which have millions to burn), and is otherwise scientifically sound. A study that tried to show GMO corn gives rats cancer, for example, was debunked when scientists pointed out they used cancer-prone rats in the study, who would have gotten sick even if they were fed organic food, or nothing at all.Ultimately, while political and economic opposition to GMO's may be valid, the science is clear that they are safe. Scientists are disappointed that anti-GMO activists, like anti-vaccine activists and climate change deniers, are twisting the facts or denying overwhelming evidence to lie to their constituency and get political points.","2013-05-29T08:42:33.570Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxMTUyODc3","19","1152877","What are some good widely accepted scientific research studies about the safety of GMO products?","https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-widely-accepted-scientific-research-studies-about-the-safety-of-GMO-products"

"14","The only proven health issues with GMOs are possible allergic reactions. But those occur with non GMO foods too. The health and environmental benefits of GMO foods are substantial: higher nutrition levels, fewer inputs(fertilizer and pesticides) higher yields, longer season, wider range of growing areas, etc. I wii cite a couple of real, not theoretical, examples.In the western US the Pink Bollworm (PBW) is a big threat to cotton. It only feeds on cotton and okra, a close relative. The adult moth lays eggs on the cotton boll (fruiting structure that holds the seed and lint fibers) When the eggs hatch the larva (worm) eats its way into the boll, heading for the seed, which holds the protein it needs to survive. The worm is vulnerable to chemical control for 2–3 days, then it is too far into the boll to kill. Once the worm reaches the seed the boll, and lint is ruined. Some growers try to time spraying by trapping and counting the moth flights, picking the peak times to spray. You can never get all of the worms or moths unless you spray every night, which is cost prohibitive and environmentally un sound. A recent GMO discovery has for the most part solved this problem. Plant breeders have found way to “inject” cotton with a bacteria, Bacillus Thuringensis, into cotton. The seed of that inoculated cotton actually has the bacteria in it, which spreads throughout the plant as it grows. The PBW hatches and feeds on any part of the plant and it ingests the BT, which causes the worm to die. As a result 6 to 10 pesticide applications are eliminated. That means the cotton growing regions use thousands of pounds less pesticides every season. Did I mention the Bacillus Thuringensis is certified Organic?Another example of GMO benefits is Golden Rice. Some islands in the West Pacific Rim have been growing rice for generations with low levels of micronutrients. Beta Carotene- the orange in carrots- is needed in the diets of children aged 6 months to 10 years for Vitamin A production, which is responsible for eye development and general health. A million children die each year due to vitamin deficiencies and 500,000 children lose their eyesight due to lack of Vitamin A. After nine years of research Golden Rice emerged. It has higher levels of Beta Carotene in the grain kernals, so much so that it has an orange-gold color. Two cups of Golden Rice a day provides all of the Beta Carotene needed to maintain good eyesight That’s why your Mom kept saying “Eat your carrots, you’ve never seen a blind rabbit have you?”Golden Rice production and distribution has has been hampered by some governments who delay its use or stop it with excessive regulation. BT cotton has been criticized as being “dangerous” or a product of “Frankenfarming.” But GMO agriculture can lessen fertilizer, pesticide, or even water use. Genetically Modified plants can provide more food that is more nutrient laden, stays fresh longer, and is easier to transport.American researcher Norman Borlaug was the father of the first Green Revolution in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. During that time the world’s population grew by 100%, but food production grew by 150%, proving the 1700s economist Malthus terribly wrong, and the 1900s ag economist Boserup thankfully right.

"8","An important key to understanding why Europe and the United States have chosen to regulate identical technologies in such a dissimilar fashion has to do with recent changes in politics of risk regulation in Europe. From the 1960s through the mid 1980s, the regulation of health, safety and environmental risks was generally stricter in the United States than in Europe. Since the mid 1980s, the obverse has often been the case: a wide array of European consumer and environmental regulations, including those governing GMOs, are now more restrictive than in the United States. In a number of important respects, European regulatory politics and policies over the last fifteen years resemble those of the United States between the late 1960s and the mid 1980s. They are often politicized, highly contentious and characterized by a suspicion of science and a mistrust of both government and industry. By contrast, the US regulation of GMOs resembles the European regulatory style of the 1970s: regulators have worked cooperatively with industry and been supportive of technological innovation, while non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have enjoyed little access to the policy process.That was from a very comprehensive paper on the subject of why the EU regulates GMOs more than the U.S. In short it has more to to with politics and risk aversion than actual good science.Please read the full paper to understand this more fully. Please follow my link.The Regulation of GMOs in Europe and the United States: A Case-Study of Contemporary European Regulatory PoliticsIn other words, most GMO bans or regulations are politically motivated and have nothing to do with science.What do most of the world’s scientific organizations have to say about it, including European.AAASThe American Association for the Advancement of Science is an international non-profit organization and serves some 261 affiliated societies and academies of science.“The science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe”.AMAThe premier body of physicians in the United States.“There is no scientific justification for special labeling of genetically modified foods.Bioengineered foods have been consumed for close to 20 years, and during that time, no overt consequences on human health have been reported and/or substantiated in the peer-reviewed literature.”WHOThe World Health Organization (WHO) is the direction and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.“No effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of GM foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved.ECThe European Commission (EC) is the executive body of the European Union“The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs are no more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.”NASThe National Academy of Sciences is a non-profit organization in the United Staes.

Usually it is a symptom of poverty or war. There is food available but some just can\u2019t get to the food because they either can\u2019t afford it or there are people with guns in the way blocking access.Organic production solves some of these problems because generally it takes more labor to produce high quality organic produce. Not always but quite often. More labor means jobs for those poor who can\u2019t afford food. Furthermore not only do they gain jobs, the farmer always takes their personal food off the top before selling the excess as a cash crop. So these will be well fed poor rather than starving poor.But the majority of the problem is due to agriculture purposely being wasteful in the industrial models of production.\In reality organic production models properly integrated with animals and crops in symbiosis would cause an explosion of high quality food worldwide. None need be starving. But organic production would not be able to supply some of the purposely wasteful industries industrial ag currently supplies now. For example currently the U.S. produces 14 billion + U.S. liquid gallons of ethanol fuel. This is primarily made from excess corn production beyond what is possible for every man woman and child in the world to ever eat. Organic production models don\u2019t need to purposely produce extra corn so as to purposely waste it making fuels that nobody wants anyway. It is ridiculously inefficient anyway. But it was designed that way on purpose. Simply a way for industry to purposely make money off inefficiency. It would all collapse tomorrow without multiple billions and billions in government subsidies paid for by you and me propping it up.Now instead of growing corn to make ethanol fuel additives, we allowed the great tallgrass prairies to return and raised our food on that instead? Huge increases in primary productivity so large that even taking a smaller % would still easily beat the industrial production models hands down. In fact the current subsidized production models are so inefficient, making that change would still even allow ethanol production off the excess grass! Strange as it may sound, ethanol production is so inefficient and takes so much energy to produce, even a smaller amount of grass produced ethanol would have by far more net gain in energy!Grass Makes Better Ethanol than Corn DoesAnd we know full well grass makes better beef! (If you are old enough to remember beef before feedlots) Not only just more better tasting beef per acre, but more nutritional as well.(unfortunately looks like hackers took down my best reference for health benefits, but luckily I have already posted most in long form on another Quora answer. So while all these Chico University links are now broken, you can find the citations the hard way)That leaves room for a return of wildlife as well!Grassland Birds: Fostering Habitats Using Rotational GrazingSo not only can organic feed more people, it can also rescue starving wildlife from extinction!But wait! \u2026.. There\u2019s more!Not only can organic production feed people better, provide jobs for the poor, make biofuels better, feed animals better and help wildlife better; it is also possible to mitigate man made global warming (AGW) too!Farming a climate change solutionCan we reverse global warming?In conclusion there is no reason preventing change to organic production systems worldwide excepting to feed the profits of a parasitic elite class that profit off the suffering of others. The big boys don\u2019t want the change and are doing everything in their power to prevent it. Why? Because they are not clever enough to profit from economies of abundance, having made all their profits from economies of scarcity. They are just not smart enough. Sorry but it is truth.

What will it end up in, no one can tell.This is despite they are NOT a genetically modified creature - they are totally normal, but we cant even take them back.GMOs are much more virulent. They are modified to not be able to produce by themselves in the wild. However, they can crossbreed with other organisms of their own species, and therefore you can never tell when one of the strains that you were putting in the wild will succeed in breaking away and changing maybe entire wold with no way to turn it back.And the effects of the combinations of the modified genes with whichever non modified member of their species they mate and breed outside the lab, is not known, and due to insane number of probabilities which span variations and future generations, will never be known.There is a reason why environmental organizations set up a seed bank in Norway to protect original, unmodified versions of our fauna and flora.Svalbard Global Seed Vault","2015-10-14T02:07:16.836Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDo1NTYyMzg1","27","5562385","Is GMO food really harmful to human health and banned in some developed countries like US?","https://www.quora.com/Is-GMO-food-really-harmful-to-human-health-and-banned-in-some-developed-countries-like-US"

And, not coincidentally, those chemicals are also sold by the companies which sell the patented seeds. Sure, that doesn’t describe all GMOs, but it does describe many. Feel free to peruse the approved varieties listed below.GM Approval Database- ISAAA.orgPeople will argue that GMOs are the answer to meeting food production demands for a growing global population. They say that current methods without GMOs won’t satisfy that demand after a point. I don’t think this is the right way to solve that problem — its like coming up with a drug to deal with the side-effects of another drug, but ignoring the original cause.What’s really going on is a degradation of soil as a natural resource as a result of conventional agriculture. Throwing more intensive conventional agriculture at the problem to circumvent the lowered output of a degraded resource will only further degrade that resource over time. The better answer would be to seek to replenish that resource — to rebuild soil. And the better way to do that is through no-till agriculture which integrates pastured livestock management and crop rotation.Here is a relatively short video of Gabe Brown giving a TedTalk on no-till agriculture.If you have the time for a much longer talk, which includes comparison of soil composition and testing, yields, water usage, etc., you’ll find others by searching on YouTube.no-till farming gabe brownBecause of the amount of information presented, these are considerably longer.These are real farmers using systems that rely less or not at all on costly chemical inputs — including fertilizer. Their production has gone up, and by integrating several revenue streams into their farming, they are able to get a lot more from their land than if they adopted conventional repeat-monocropping with chemical additions and patented seed. And while they’re at it, they’re rebuilding soil and sequestering carbon. To me, this is a better path than tweaking crops to be able to grow after being sprayed with herbicides.I’m not against all GMOs at all. I think there is much good that can come of this tool — the GMO virus-resistant papaya comes to mind, which can be grown where Papaya Ringspot Virus is prevalent and would otherwise make raising this crop impossible. So before anyone replies to this answer with “GMOs are safe” or “you’re anti-science” please just don’t bother. That’s not what my angst against some of them (i.e. herbicide-resistant crops) is about. I just don’t think they’re all they’re hyped to be, nor are they the solution I’d prefer. We don’t need to tweak crops to produce better in degraded soil — we need to replenish the soil.ETA — I keep trying to copy the video URL to start at the beginning, but it doesn’t seem to be working. So if you click the videos, just drag it back to the beginning.","2013-03-07T17:54:39.685Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoxMDEzNDg5","28","1013489","What is your review of Genetically Modified Foods?","https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-Genetically-Modified-Foods"

"16","Why was GMO invented?GMO was invented to enable plants to have characteristics that we value. Some GMO plants are naturally resistant to pests, which allows farmers to use less pesticides.Some GMO plants have greater nutritional value than non-GMO plants. Golden rice (Golden rice - Wikipedia) is an example. Up to 2 million people every year die from vitamin A deficiency and another 500,000 go blind each year. Golden rice contains vitamin A precursors, and could virtually solve this problem.Humans have been selectively breeding plants since farming began. GMO is the logical extension of this.I do the grocery shopping in my family, and I try to watch for foods that are labeled “Non-GMO”, and then I don’t buy them. GMO products are safe and have the potential to greatly reduce world hunger, make food safer and more nutritious, and prevent some crops from being wiped out.I know this will not be a popular opinion with the conspiracy theory crowd, but in my view people who avoid GMO products do so out of fear of what they don’t understand. Given a choice, I always buy GMO.","2018-04-24T14:36:45.976Z","UXVlc3Rpb25AMDoyNzAwMjYzOQ==","30","27002639","Why were GMOs created?","https://www.quora.com/Why-were-GMOs-created"
