"Title: How safe does transgenic food need to be? Nature Biotech ||| Selftext:  ||| Comments: > Transgenic crops are the most highly regulated foods in the world. In recent years, there have been calls in the United States to relax some of the rules for their oversight. And yet controversies over the safety of transgenic food products continue to rumble, particularly in Europe, Africa and now further afield in the Far East. Despite the fact that numerous national and international scientific panels have concluded that food derived through transgenic approaches is as safe as food produced in other ways and that food-borne pathogens pose a much greater threat to human health1, scare stories continue to appear in the media and questions continue to be asked about the adequacy of current regulatory systems to determine the safety of our food, transgenic or otherwise. > Why, after transgenic products have been in the human food chain for more than a decade without overt ill effects, do these doubts persist? And will it ever be possible to gather sufficient evidence to ameliorate the concerns of skeptics and the public at large that these products are as safe as any other foodstuff? > **Different strokes** > Regulators in the United States and the European Union (EU; Brussels) approach the issue of safeguarding the food supply in different ways. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a voluntary process that leaves the burden of ensuring the safety of new foods to the developers, under the notion of 'substantial equivalence': “if a new food is found to be substantially equivalent to an existing food, the food can be concluded to be as safe as the conventional food” (slightly edited for readability from ref. 2). > “There are no pre-market reviews of approvals required of foods. Instead, manufacturers or distributors bear the burden of ensuring that any finished food placed on the market meets the safety levels implicit in the definition of adulterated foods. FDA is authorized to seek sanctions against foods that do not adhere to these standards through seizure, injunction or criminal prosecution,” writes Emily Marden of the University of British Columbia's Faculty of Law in Vancouver3. This holds for all new foods, whether transgenic or not. > Notwithstanding the absence of legal underpinnings, a de facto regulatory process (called a consultation) exists at the FDA, whereby companies submit information on new genetically modified foods destined for the market (Supplementary Box 1). > In contrast, since the European Council adopted Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms in 1990 (ref. 4), the EU has increasingly employed the precautionary principle, which requires developers to prove the safety of any new food that has “not hitherto been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the community” before it can be placed on the market. This includes transgenic products under the EU Directive 90/220/EEC covering plants and the Regulation (EC) 258/97, which relates to novel foods and food ingredients. “In Europe...you can't get a food on the market until it's met safety criteria,” says Julian Kinderlerer, professor of law at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. In the United States, “foods are subject to generally-recognized-as-safe criteria,” he adds. “The FDA can't stop something from going on the market; they have to go to court to get it off.” > **The assessment process** > The United States has had a tripartite regulatory process for transgenic crops since 1986 when the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology was laid out (51 Fed. Reg. 23302, June 26, 1986)5. Depending on the exact nature of the change made to the crop, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and/or the FDA has regulatory authority. The USDA, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service within it, is responsible for regulating agricultural plant pests and noxious weeds under, among others, the Plant Protection Act and so looks at the environmental impact of transgenic crops; similarly the EPA is responsible for oversight of transgenic crops that contain pesticides within them under regulations for “plant-incorporated pesticides.” But it is the FDA and its Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition that is responsible for oversight of the safety of food derived from transgenic crops destined for human consumption. Under the “adulterated food provisions” of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act6, the FDA regulates such food using the principle of history of safe use: a substance may be considered to have a history of safe use as a food if it has been an ongoing part of the diet for several generations in a large genetically diverse human population. > Seed companies developing food ingredients submit a package of information on a transgenic product that includes the source of the gene, characterization of the insert and some compositional analysis of the new food. Tests are targeted to measure specific molecules or entities—plant toxins, anti-nutrients and allergens—to look for unintended up- or downregulation of critical molecules that might have occurred during the creation of the transgenic plant. Toxicology and allergenicity studies are typically conducted on the isolated proteins or molecules to be newly expressed in the plant, although often the material for testing is made by recombinant techniques in bacteria (and the resultant protein may have small differences in post-translational modifications from the version made in the transgenic plant), and rarely in the context of the plant. This is because of the difficulty of isolating the protein from a plant in sufficient quantities for testing and due to the complexity of feeding studies with whole foods. No animal or human feeding studies are mentioned in FDA's guidance document7. > Since 2002, the EU has had a consultancy in place—the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)—that specifically provides advice on risk assessment of foods, including transgenic crops. The process for evaluating transgenic crops is based largely on guidances set out by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO; Rome), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (Paris), the World Health Organization (WHO; Geneva) and the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius (reviewed in ref. 8). EFSA's guidance documents are more detailed than those of the FDA, but much is still left up to the developers of new foods as to the exact information they provide. Both the FDA and EFSA require similar kinds of information on the nature of the genetic insert and the plant. Whereas feeding studies are at least mentioned in EFSA guidances, they are not required. However, the EU recently issued a revised guidance requiring 90-day feeding studies; EFSA is arguing that it should be done only when deemed necessary9. > Compositional analyses of 129 transgenic crops submitted to the FDA for marketing authority from 1995 to 2012 have all failed to detect any significant differences—or any believed to have biological relevance—between the engineered plant and its nonengineered counterpart or reference species according to an analysis of the literature conducted jointly by FDA and Dow AgroScience scientists10. Included in the compositional analysis are proximates (crude measures of protein, fat, ash and fiber), amino acids, fatty acids, calcium and phosphate. Were significant differences from natural variation of an isogenic to be detected, they would become the focus of further investigation. > For all transgenic events commercialized so far, the concentration of the newly introduced protein in the context of a whole plant (and the consumable parts derived from it) has been so low that it has been considered not to pose a risk. Thus, the position of industry and US and EU regulators is that a combination of targeted compositional analysis plus an event's phenotypic and agronomic behavior provides everything needed to establish the safety of a transgenic crop. > **Allergenicity** > Another food safety concern arising from an alteration in food composition is the possibility of increased allergenicity. Several kinds of studies address this. One type compares sequences from the new food to those of known plant allergens, whose sequences are available in various public protein databases, including one dedicated to protein allergens (http://www.allergenonline.com/). The generally accepted standard for flagging a protein as a potential allergen is homology greater than 35% over a stretch of 80 amino acids or a stretch of identical amino acids, between 6 and 8 depending on the guidance. These are conservative metrics, according to Richard Goodman, at the University of Nebraska's Food Allergy Research and Resource Program in Lincoln. “It would capture marginal sequences that are unlikely to pose a risk of cross-reactivity,” he says. Work from Goodman's laboratory and elsewhere has shown that the eight amino-acid match, in particular, is not predictive of allergenicity (ref. 11 and unpublished work from the Goodman laboratory). Goodman says that as a consequence this is being used less by food developers and regulatory agencies. In fact, EFSA has dropped the eight amino-acid matching entirely in its most recent guidance document12, and the EU is expected to adopt this this year, Goodman says. > Once regions of homology are found, various in vitro tests of allergenicity can be done (testing serum from allergic individuals, basophil release assay), although such tests on their own are not definitive. How do regulatory agencies deal with this uncertainty? > Tests such as these are rarely relied upon, according to Goodman, as proteins with high identity matches would be dropped. Instead, regulators rely on a “weight of evidence” approach, which means you look at the information in aggregate and make some kind of determination as to the likelihood of problems occurring. > A second approach to determining allergenicity of a protein is to measure its stability in low pH conditions and/or in the presence of pepsin. Considerable effort has been put in by FAO and WHO to standardize these tests13, but the exact conditions are determined by the developer of the plant, not the regulatory agency. > A frequently cited example from the 1990s generally comes up when discussing the ability to detect whether a newly created food is allergenic. A methionine-rich protein (2S albumin) from the Brazil nut was inserted into soybean by scientists at the University of Nebraska and the agbiotech company Pioneer Hybrid of Johnston, Iowa, to improve the nutritional balance of soy for use as poultry feed (and reduce the need for costly feed supplements). However, the engineered soy plant was found to cause skin reactions in people allergic to Brazil nuts, which confirmed that an allergen can be transferred from one plant to another. This finding not only eliminated the plant from the product pipeline before any harm was done—a testament to the ability of the available tests to detect introduced allergens—but also enabled researchers to identify the source of the allergy in Brazil nuts, which, before this, was unknown14. > In this case, a protein was taken from a plant known to be allergenic in humans, for which human immune sera exist for testing purposes. Nowadays, such transfers are less likely to be done, which makes testing for allergenicity a challenge, according to Hugh Sampson, professor of pediatrics, allergy and immunology at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, who in 2001 served as an advisor to the EPA on allergenicity studies of the Cry9c protein, present in Starlink corn. “If you bring a novel protein in, where we don't know if people are allergic, we can't really screen for what we don't know,” he says. > Whereas the incidence of food allergies are on the rise (CDC reports the incidence of food allergies in children under 18 rose from 3.4% to 5.1% between 1997 and 2011), the cause of the rise, as well as whether it is linked to new allergens or existing ones, is not clear. However, the possibility of introducing a food allergen exists in all new foods (e.g., kiwi fruit, introduced into the American diet rather recently, turned out to be allergenic), and is not limited to genetically modified foods. > Neither allergenicity or toxicity has been a problem, according to Alan McHughen, cooperative extension specialist in biotechnology for sustainable agriculture at the University of California, Riverside, who was a member of a panel convened in 2004 by the National Research Council of the US National Academy of Sciences to assess safety testing of transgenic foods. “We say in [the resulting report] that we were unable to identify any actual incidence of harm from the consumption of genetically engineered foods, and during our public input session, we requested people to bring us evidence. None of those were borne out”15. However, this group did find the potential for unintended changes to be higher for genetically modified crops than most other modification techniques (Fig. 1).",Reddit,Transgenic foods are safe but face ongoing public skepticism and regulatory differences between the US and EU.,Mixed - confidence in safety data but concern over public doubts and regulation,Scientist/Researcher,Mixed
