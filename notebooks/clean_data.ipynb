         "Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \\more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.  If you want to make a change, do it with your wallet.Also, please keep in mind that most GMO crops are grown as feed for livestock.  So you must keep meat and dairy choices in mind when shopping, as well.",

         "You can take this question in one of two ways.  If you want to answer the question \\proactively label their GMO-containing foods?\\Justin Ma has a great answer.  I take the question to mean \\regulations that require them to label food that contains GMO-derived ingredients?\\I will focus on the United States, since that is where I am most familiar with the regulatory environment. Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \\The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do. Basically, the people who just claim that mandatory labeling laws would just \\For those who insist on providing information to consumers, there is a way you can do this: label your own products the way you want, and don't force others to do so.

         "Genetically Modified Organism. However what that means can be one of contention and you really need to ask who you are talking to. In many debates they are talking about intergenus genetic modification (of any process) especially those like Bt-Ready and Roundup-Ready. The anti-GMO debates tend to be mostly anti-Monsanto and focus on those types of modification.Some labeling laws have limited their scope to just this as well. Vermont's H.112 (Page on State) defines it as \\The organic standard is a bit more direct: \\Excluded methods. A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production. Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macroencapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology). Such methods do not include the use of traditional breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture.\\Code of Federal Regulations)Some researchers are trying to separate the terms and use other terms for what they do depending on whether they are doing their breeding outside taxonomic group or not. There are also some trying to argue the organic standard should take the difference in public opinion (breeding vs anti-monsanto) into account (see Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics, and the Future of Food: Pamela C.

         "The same exact reason people are opposed to lab-grown diamonds: because an industry that makes immense profits from “organic” food has spent billions of dollars waging an immense propaganda campaign to whip people who don’t know how to do their research into a frenzy targeted at their business rivals.You even see some of that propaganda being repeated right here in the answers to this question, by people who sincerely believe whatever they’re told they’re saying.There’s a great example of this right here in this answer thread, by Tomaž Vargazon. I’m not picking on him; I generally find his content well-written and well-researched. But in this case, his answer is filled with misinformation and urban legend.For example, a common urban legend is that Monsanto sued farmers for accidental contamination, pursuing anyone with even a few stray plants in their fields so aggressively they bankrupted them.This story was invented by one man, a farmer in Indiana named Vernon Hugh Bowman. He collected soybean seeds from a grain elevator, planted them, then sprayed them with glyphosate to kill the ones that were not GM. He then planted his entire field with them.He tried claiming “accidental contamination” when he was sued, spinning a yarn that not even a jury of his peers believed. (Hint, when more than 95% of the plants on your farm are the same strain, that’s no accident, LOL.) He was convicted by a jury of his peers, but the story he spun stuck.I used to believe this story myself, just like Tomaž. Then someone challenged me to the same challenge I am about to make to Tomaž, and anyone else weho believes it:Name the farmers sued for this.All court cases in the US are public. If this happened, there should be plenty of examples. Cite cases. Name someone. You won’t be able to do it.In fact, Monsanto sent out people free of charge to clean out accidental contamination from any farmer who reported it.As for the “dangers” of glyphosate:Moreover, the company hid internal studies that showed their key moneymaking herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) wasn’t as safe as advertised. It was linked to an increase of cancer risk with gross overexposure.No.The overall incidence of cancer amongst people exposed to glyphosate is lower (yes, seriously!) than baseline.Lower. Not higher. Yes, seriously.The UN “study” that listed glyphosate as a “suspected carcinogen” is widely ridiculed in medical and scientific communities.So, why does this happen?$$$ money $$$Whenever you have a huge amount of money on the line, you will have a huge amount of money available for propaganda.People like to say Monsanto was this huge megacorporation. Actually, no, when it existed, it was kind of a pipsqueak.Organic foods, on the other hand, are an immense, fat-profit business. Sales of organic foods are more than triple Monsanto’s revenues.Organic food is huge, with much fatter profits than conventional or GM food, and organic food makers have poured billions of dollars over the yearsinto anti-GM propaganda—propaganda that well-meaning, otherwise intelligent people accept because it matches their bisaes and fears.I come to this from the position of a person who once believed as Tomaž and others do: Monsanto was an evil giant megacorporation, GM companies patented foods and that was bad, they bullied small farmers, and so on and so on.I started questioning that narrative when I started asking specific questions:How big is the GM food industry? How big is the organic food industry? Which is bigger?What farmers did Monsanto bully, specifically? What were their names? What were the case numbers? What farmers “lost their farms” because of Monsanto? Who were they?If GM food is bad because of food patents, then why did the first food patents get issued in the 1800s, before genetic engineering was a thing? Why are organic foods patented? (Spoilter: Yes, organic and conventional foods are also patented! Surprise! It’s amazing how many people legitimately don’t know this.)Once you start down these rabbit holes, you end up in a very different place than you started from.Why are so many people opposed to GM food? Because people are fearful about food in general, people have a purity fetish around food, and a lot of extremely profitable corporations spend a ton of money to make people frightened of GM food.Add in anti-corporate narratives and it becomes an easy sell.",

         "No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \\Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.",

         "Well, it is a topic on which a long debate could be done on.As being a biotechnologist (pursing undergraduate course in biotech), my views are as follows:A variety of GM crops are being harvested in various parts of the world and many are still being worked on. The best part of GM crops is their high yield, good nutritional quality, a good shelf life, could be harvested in lesser time than the normal ones and the point of my interest- could be used to make edible vaccines (would'nt it be great- nutrition and vaccination all in a single shot- could be quite handy for poor countries and UN). Now on to the GM organisms. Till now, I have not known to any GMO. But I still know that they are being worked on. Their best use could be for MOLECULAR PHARMING (i.e obtaining vaccines and other biological agents like insulin from animal milk or any other by-product). Their are many GM Microorganisms, which are being used industrially in breweries and other pharmaceutical or I should say neutraceutical (nutritional + pharmaceutical) companies, and have revolutionized this sector.But the cons are bio-ethics. I am stating them below:These modifications are considered to be \\These modified organisms might get out of the control and breed with the wild/domestic species thereby causing Mutants or any other lethal organism like super-weeds.Often these genes are taken from virus sources, wich inturn might not be harmful at present condtion but might be in future.Ecological concerns ; these new species might overcome the existing ones and could cause harm to the ecological balance or could change the evolutionary pattern.Effect of GM crops on non-target species.The GM crops might change the fundamental vegetable nature of plants as the genes from animals are being used in crop plants. In simple words, plants would be no more remain vegetarian but would turn a non-vegetarian food. (Creepy!!! Isnt it?)\\n\\nBut my verdict is, if these GMOs and GMCs are the future. But they must be sold with a label \\",

         "Music.Music is what happens when a song is played -- either a performance or a recording of a performance. Music cannot be separated from the experience of listening to it in a way that can be owned.Recordings aren't even owned. They are licensed to you for limited uses by the copyright holders, in most cases, it'd the record label the artist has signed over their rights to.What we think of as the recordings we own on digital file, CD, phonograph, cassette, 8-track, or whatever -- these are merely containers for the recordings. We own the containers, but we do not own the recordings contained within them.It all boils down to this: what we think of as ownership of music is actually us paying for the right to access the music. In a world where the technological cost of providing global access to the entire history of recorded music is easily covered by charging a small fee or tax for access, the idea of music ownership will and should be considered anachronistic. Music is free. What we pay for is access.Of course, musicians need some sort of fair compensation to stimulate the production of music. This is the purpose of copyright in the first place. But musicians have never been fairly compensated for their music. Over the last few centuries, a microscopic minority of musicians became wealthy, while the music industry itself grew to a multibillion dollar enterprise. Increasingly, copyright is used by corporations to stifle technological innovation the maintain the status quo of musician exploitation and the lie of musical ownership. Prior to the invention of the recording, music could only be generated through a performance. There had to be musicians playing within earshot in order for one to experience music. Or, you had to play the song yourself. The economics were simple -- musicians enjoyed the support of their patrons, and later, the public became patron as live music flourished. The recording -- and the concept of music ownership -- shut down much of this burgeoning live music scene. The great irony is that after the recording dominated 20th century music, the 21st century brought the disruption of digital distribution, causing us to give new value the live performance and viewing the recording for what it really is -- a facsimile of a single performance. As such, we have a new generation of listeners and musicians that recognize music ownership is a capitalist illusion, access to music should be free like tap water (which we perceive as free but in reality is paid for as a utility), and live performance should be held up as the ultimate authentic music experience. This is why the concert industry is booming and record sales are plummeting.",

         "A genetically modified organism, is simply an organism who’s genes has been modified, as a result of human intervention by performing genetic engineering. This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is! And how/what’s that? We take the gene, that acts like a blueprint on how to make this hormone, from a healthy person. We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin. Soon, you have thousands of bacteria producing this hormone, and the quantity and quality of this insulin is good enough to become an economically viable manufacturing process, and that’s how you get insulin these days.So who was the GMO here? It was the bacteria. You manipulated the genetic material of the bacteria, so that it produced more insulin, which was for your own benefit, and made medicine cheaper.By the way, which kind of egg do you have?",

The reduction of pesticides, increase of crop nutrition and the increase of resistance of crops and yield per field all sound like healthy and green things to me. This runs so counter to the psuedo science out there that the common thing, if you say genetically modified crops are green, is to be accused of being a, er, plant. I'm pro green, pro science and it's lead me to knowing the concept of organic food being green and healthy and geneticially modified crops being ungreen and bad for the health, if anything, are backwards. Organic crops are often far from green to produce due to the resources needed to produce them. Organic meat, for example, has a much higher carbon footprint than non organic.

         "I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control. This is not product that is being sold to help American families.The link below was deleted by the magazine after sharing. Here is the backup.China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be Buying (deleted after sharing)China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be BuyingThe Snack Food and Corn Syrup Lobbyist Shaping Guidelines for AmericansIf you’re consuming mostly genetically modified organisms into your diet, it means that you are not cooking your food from scratch. Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day. That is pretty sad.",

That’s the question of importance.Organic means that it has been grown without the application of synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. However, this does not prohibit the farmer from applying natural pesticides (pyrethrines) at high concentrations too close to harvest or applying manure from animals that were given high doses of antibiotics.The responsibility of what is good or not lies with the farmer. Not the product.If you follow the instructions of how to properly grow a crop from an agronomist it does not matter, which method or seed you use; organic or conventional farming, non-gmo or gmo. There are no nutritional differences measured from either type of crop cultivation. Flavor-wise it is better to buy from a farmer’s market than a supermarket, where they harvest immature vegetables and fruits, but nutritionally they are almost identical as well.Non-GMOs means that the product has been produced through traditional breeding methods which is a very long procedure (10–15 years). GMOs could have a disease resistance or drought resistance gene inside them from a related species or not, etc. This has absolutely no effect on you, unless we are talking about a toxin introduced into the plant, which companies avoid anyway doing that. Companies do not want dead or ill consumers. They want hungry and healthy consumers to keep buying their products. Period.So, to answer your question:I would consider more important Organic vs non-organic, although there is no practical difference between them for you. I just expect that Organic farmers would be more diligent as small-scale farmers about their concern for your food. GMOs vs non-GMOs just does not matter.Personally I would choose the farmer first and then my products.",

         "Thanks for he A2A.\\n \\nI am uneasy about these answers here. Not that they are wrong, they're not. But they aren't telling the full story.\\n \\nLet's look at some common GMO crops. Corn. Soybeans. Cotton. Canola ( rapeseed). Alfalfa. There's more, but these will do fine for what we are talking about.\\n \\nNow we need to separate the crops into 2 subsets. Those crops that are self pollinated and those that are outcrossers. Selfers are plants that pollinate themselves by having the pollen drop into the stigma of the flower without needing outside help, like an insect or the wind, thus ensuring a tomato, or a chile pepper, or a wheat kernel. \\n \\n \\nOutcrossers need help to spread pollen. That head of broccoli needed mostly bees to help create it, or that ear of corn needed some strong wind to spread pollen.\\n \\nOk. So. Selfers- Soybeans. Cotton. \\n \\nOutcrossers.- Corn. Canola. Alfalfa. \\n \\nCrops that are selfers don't suffer from inbreeding depression, a term that means they lose their viability over time from having too little genetic diversity during the growing season. So saving seed from one tomato plant, one wheat plant, one bean plant is fine. That seed can be grown and resaved for a lifetime.\\n \\nOutcrossers aren't like that. They need lot's of genetic diversity, which to the farmer means they  grow a lot of plants. One broccoli plant? No way. One carrot plant, one corn plant, one canola plant? No. Think at least 500 to start, and no less than 100 to finish. They need pollination from a large population of plants. Without this, the seed is very poor, genetically bottlenecked and usually unfit for next generational use. \\n \\nOk?\\n \\nNow let's further separate these crops into 2 types. Open pollinated and hybrid. \\n \\nOP crops are old fashioned crops that our grandparents and parents grew, including heirloom varieties. If you grow, for example, an heirloom tomato, and decide to pull some seeds out of one of the tomatoes, it will \\hybrid vigor, and clearly outshines the parents. Note the term F1 on the seed packet.\\n \\nHowever , when you pull some seeds out of that hybrid tomato, and plant them the next year, they don't come true.

         "I have trouble with the terminology, but the concepts are clear.GMO, or genetically modified organisms, are the essence of agriculture. For thousands of years, farmers, agronomists, plant scientists have used plant and animal breeding to manipulate the genetic makeup of the foods we eat. That is a good thing.However, GMOs as they are developed today, uses recombinant DNA manipulation to alter the attributes of the plants. As a result, it is possible to introduce changes that we would never see in nature (i.e. introduction of animal characteristics into plant material). While that’s not necessarily bad, we also greatly reduce the time it takes to see the changes in the material, and therefore we can’t fully investigate the unintended consequences of our manipulations. Every technological innovation has risks of unintended consequences, but genetic manipulation can have broad, catastrophic impacts. It’s kind of like nuclear power generation: it’s a great thing when everything is fine, and failure may be very rare, but the impacts can be huge. I advocate continuing research, but proceeding slowly. I also believe in detailed labelling to enable consumers to make their own choices.Organic foods fall into a different category. The term “organic” is meaningless and requires significant explanation in order to be useful for consumers. I do not believe that inorganic fertilizers are “bad” and I do not believe that all herbicides and pesticides are bad. Again, it’s a matter of really looking into the specific practices of cultivation. That’s one reason why I do agree with buying from local producers: the consumer has the ability to find out exactly how something was produced and to talk to the producer.",

In fact, there's a list: Studies with independent fundingThe conclusions are clear: no negative effects. GMO's are just as nutritious as non-GMO's (except when they are designed to be even more nutritious, like Golden Rice) and cause no health problems. Here is a literature review of these results, and another assessment of GE food safety here.Note that studies do exist saying GMO's are bad… but you asked for good ones. Studies existed saying vaccines cause autism and that cigarettes are harmless, but those studies were flawed and a few were retracted. It is important to 1) not let a single study trump the dozens of studies that contradict it, 2) not confuse opinion papers with actual science research, and 3) be sure that any study has valid controls, a large sample size, no conflict of interest (be it big-Agritech or big-Organic, both of which have millions to burn), and is otherwise scientifically sound. A study that tried to show GMO corn gives rats cancer, for example, was debunked when scientists pointed out they used cancer-prone rats in the study, who would have gotten sick even if they were fed organic food, or nothing at all.Ultimately, while political and economic opposition to GMO's may be valid, the science is clear that they are safe. Scientists are disappointed that anti-GMO activists, like anti-vaccine activists and climate change deniers, are twisting the facts or denying overwhelming evidence to lie to their constituency and get political points.",

         "The only proven health issues with GMOs are possible allergic reactions. But those occur with non GMO foods too. The health and environmental benefits of GMO foods are substantial: higher nutrition levels, fewer inputs(fertilizer and pesticides) higher yields, longer season, wider range of growing areas, etc. I wii cite a couple of real, not theoretical, examples.In the western US the Pink Bollworm (PBW) is a big threat to cotton. It only feeds on cotton and okra, a close relative. The adult moth lays eggs on the cotton boll (fruiting structure that holds the seed and lint fibers) When the eggs hatch the larva (worm) eats its way into the boll, heading for the seed, which holds the protein it needs to survive. The worm is vulnerable to chemical control for 2–3 days, then it is too far into the boll to kill. Once the worm reaches the seed the boll, and lint is ruined. Some growers try to time spraying by trapping and counting the moth flights, picking the peak times to spray. You can never get all of the worms or moths unless you spray every night, which is cost prohibitive and environmentally un sound. A recent GMO discovery has for the most part solved this problem. Plant breeders have found way to “inject” cotton with a bacteria, Bacillus Thuringensis, into cotton. The seed of that inoculated cotton actually has the bacteria in it, which spreads throughout the plant as it grows. The PBW hatches and feeds on any part of the plant and it ingests the BT, which causes the worm to die. As a result 6 to 10 pesticide applications are eliminated. That means the cotton growing regions use thousands of pounds less pesticides every season. Did I mention the Bacillus Thuringensis is certified Organic?Another example of GMO benefits is Golden Rice. Some islands in the West Pacific Rim have been growing rice for generations with low levels of micronutrients. Beta Carotene- the orange in carrots- is needed in the diets of children aged 6 months to 10 years for Vitamin A production, which is responsible for eye development and general health. A million children die each year due to vitamin deficiencies and 500,000 children lose their eyesight due to lack of Vitamin A. After nine years of research Golden Rice emerged. It has higher levels of Beta Carotene in the grain kernals, so much so that it has an orange-gold color. Two cups of Golden Rice a day provides all of the Beta Carotene needed to maintain good eyesight That’s why your Mom kept saying “Eat your carrots, you’ve never seen a blind rabbit have you?”Golden Rice production and distribution has has been hampered by some governments who delay its use or stop it with excessive regulation. BT cotton has been criticized as being “dangerous” or a product of “Frankenfarming.” But GMO agriculture can lessen fertilizer, pesticide, or even water use. Genetically Modified plants can provide more food that is more nutrient laden, stays fresh longer, and is easier to transport.American researcher Norman Borlaug was the father of the first Green Revolution in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. During that time the world’s population grew by 100%, but food production grew by 150%, proving the 1700s economist Malthus terribly wrong, and the 1900s ag economist Boserup thankfully right. GMOs represent the next Green Revolution.",

         "An important key to understanding why Europe and the United States have chosen to regulate identical technologies in such a dissimilar fashion has to do with recent changes in politics of risk regulation in Europe. From the 1960s through the mid 1980s, the regulation of health, safety and environmental risks was generally stricter in the United States than in Europe. Since the mid 1980s, the obverse has often been the case: a wide array of European consumer and environmental regulations, including those governing GMOs, are now more restrictive than in the United States. In a number of important respects, European regulatory politics and policies over the last fifteen years resemble those of the United States between the late 1960s and the mid 1980s. They are often politicized, highly contentious and characterized by a suspicion of science and a mistrust of both government and industry. By contrast, the US regulation of GMOs resembles the European regulatory style of the 1970s: regulators have worked cooperatively with industry and been supportive of technological innovation, while non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have enjoyed little access to the policy process.That was from a very comprehensive paper on the subject of why the EU regulates GMOs more than the U.S. In short it has more to to with politics and risk aversion than actual good science.Please read the full paper to understand this more fully. Please follow my link.The Regulation of GMOs in Europe and the United States: A Case-Study of Contemporary European Regulatory PoliticsIn other words, most GMO bans or regulations are politically motivated and have nothing to do with science.What do most of the world’s scientific organizations have to say about it, including European.AAASThe American Association for the Advancement of Science is an international non-profit organization and serves some 261 affiliated societies and academies of science.“The science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe”.AMAThe premier body of physicians in the United States.“There is no scientific justification for special labeling of genetically modified foods.Bioengineered foods have been consumed for close to 20 years, and during that time, no overt consequences on human health have been reported and/or substantiated in the peer-reviewed literature.”WHOThe World Health Organization (WHO) is the direction and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.“No effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of GM foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved.ECThe European Commission (EC) is the executive body of the European Union“The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs are no more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.”NASThe National Academy of Sciences is a non-profit organization in the United Staes. It is the premier scientific body of the United States.“To date more than 98 million acres of genetically modified crops have been grown worldwide. No evidence of human health problems associated with the ingestion of these crops or resulting food products have been identified.”The Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities is an umbrella organization for eight german academies of sciences and humanities.“In consuming food derived from GM plants approved in the EU and in the USA, the risk is in no way higher than in the consumption of food from conventionally grown plants. On the contrary, in some cases food from GM plants appears to be superior in respect to heath.”The EU bans are political. I don’t know how else to say this.",

There is food available but some just can\\u2019t get to the food because they either can\\u2019t afford it or there are people with guns in the way blocking access.Organic production solves some of these problems because generally it takes more labor to produce high quality organic produce. Not always but quite often. More labor means jobs for those poor who can\\u2019t afford food. Furthermore not only do they gain jobs, the farmer always takes their personal food off the top before selling the excess as a cash crop. So these will be well fed poor rather than starving poor.But the majority of the problem is due to agriculture purposely being wasteful in the industrial models of production.\\In reality organic production models properly integrated with animals and crops in symbiosis would cause an explosion of high quality food worldwide. None need be starving. But organic production would not be able to supply some of the purposely wasteful industries industrial ag currently supplies now. For example currently the U.S. produces 14 billion + U.S. liquid gallons of ethanol fuel. This is primarily made from excess corn production beyond what is possible for every man woman and child in the world to ever eat. Organic production models don\\u2019t need to purposely produce extra corn so as to purposely waste it making fuels that nobody wants anyway. It is ridiculously inefficient anyway. But it was designed that way on purpose. Simply a way for industry to purposely make money off inefficiency. It would all collapse tomorrow without multiple billions and billions in government subsidies paid for by you and me propping it up.Now instead of growing corn to make ethanol fuel additives, we allowed the great tallgrass prairies to return and raised our food on that instead? Huge increases in primary productivity so large that even taking a smaller % would still easily beat the industrial production models hands down. In fact the current subsidized production models are so inefficient, making that change would still even allow ethanol production off the excess grass! Strange as it may sound, ethanol production is so inefficient and takes so much energy to produce, even a smaller amount of grass produced ethanol would have by far more net gain in energy!Grass Makes Better Ethanol than Corn DoesAnd we know full well grass makes better beef! (If you are old enough to remember beef before feedlots) Not only just more better tasting beef per acre, but more nutritional as well.(unfortunately looks like hackers took down my best reference for health benefits, but luckily I have already posted most in long form on another Quora answer. So while all these Chico University links are now broken, you can find the citations the hard way)That leaves room for a return of wildlife as well!Grassland Birds: Fostering Habitats Using Rotational GrazingSo not only can organic feed more people, it can also rescue starving wildlife from extinction!But wait! \\u2026.. There\\u2019s more!Not only can organic production feed people better, provide jobs for the poor, make biofuels better, feed animals better and help wildlife better; it is also possible to mitigate man made global warming (AGW) too!Farming a climate change solutionCan we reverse global warming?In conclusion there is no reason preventing change to organic production systems worldwide excepting to feed the profits of a parasitic elite class that profit off the suffering of others. The big boys don\\u2019t want the change and are doing everything in their power to prevent it. Why? Because they are not clever enough to profit from economies of abundance, having made all their profits from economies of scarcity. They are just not smart enough. Sorry but it is truth. Most the so called elites are really quite stupid, but have managed to rig the system in such a way as to stay on top by economic brute force and ignorance.\\u201cI am an organic farmer. I am not afraid of change. I am the change.\\u201d",

         "There are strong studies which linked GMOs to harmful effects, including cancer.This famous French study was first dropped from the journal due to pressure and lobbying from Monsanto corporation and other american interests, but when its researchers sued the journal in the court and won on grounds that the research and its data was scientifically solid and viable, it was republished by the very same journal that dropped it upon pressure, by court order.Page on the-scientist.comThis study - Seralini Study - basically repeated the exact experiment Monsanto corporation used to vouch for the safety of its GMOs. The difference is that, Monsanto's test duration was merely 90 days, whereas Seralini study kept the experiment going for Two years.\nThis is the Seralini team's official website:GMO SeraliniHere is where they answer all criticism:Critics answeredLong story short, the French GMO study which linked GMOs to cancer in rats is valid, solid, and not 'debunked' as so many corporate outlets in USA claim - some of which immediately proceeded to 'debunk' the study even without one week passing from its publication.This example should illustrate what kind of political games and profits hang around the concept of GMOs.You can see what kind of pressure corporations have their governments exert from below example:EU dropped plans for safer pesticides after pressure from USYou can guess that it is no different in the case of GMO studies around the world.And yes, GMOs are banned in many countries:Twenty-Six Countries Ban GMOs—Why Won’t the US?The article asks, why doesn't US ban GMOs...The reason is simple and is a two word phrase: Monsanto Corporation.This is a massive corporation which does exorbitant profits based on GMOs. Incidentally, they are also the inventors and producers of Agent Orange chemical weapon, which USA used in Vietnam. And Aspartame artificial sweetener , which was linked to cancer itself.Aspartame controversyNow, the reason why such stuff are 'controversial' is solely because these corporations spend massive funds in order to do propaganda for their benefit. Like how they declared they were going to spend advertising money to combat 'global warming propaganda', and thus made global warming a 'controversial issue' in USA - not the rest of the world, or how energy saving light bulbs have become a 'cancerous, dangerous technology' in USA with same kind of advertising spending - to the extent that there is a strong segment of americans who think that incandescent lightbulbs are 'freedom' and they are 'safe'. While they pay ~70% more for the lighting they are using with incandescent bulbs.............GMOs actually pose a far greater danger than cancer risk or other health risks to individuals:Once a modified organism gets out into the wild and succeeds in reproducing, you can never take it back. Consider it like a virus.And you can never expect what the effects of such a rogue GMO will be in the wild in the broader ecosystems - on insects, other plants, and bigger animals and eventually entire ecosystems.To understand how big ecosystem damage can be, consider the case of big snakes (pythons) which had been released into the wild by pet owners from Florida when they grew too big:Florida Python Invasion: ‘No Going Back’ As Snake Population Spirals Out Of ControlThey are a plague now, totally changing the ecosystem by their presence. What will it end up in, no one can tell.This is despite they are NOT a genetically modified creature - they are totally normal, but we cant even take them back.GMOs are much more virulent. They are modified to not be able to produce by themselves in the wild. However, they can crossbreed with other organisms of their own species, and therefore you can never tell when one of the strains that you were putting in the wild will succeed in breaking away and changing maybe entire wold with no way to turn it back.And the effects of the combinations of the modified genes with whichever non modified member of their species they mate and breed outside the lab, is not known, and due to insane number of probabilities which span variations and future generations, will never be known.There is a reason why environmental organizations set up a seed bank in Norway to protect original, unmodified versions of our fauna and flora.Svalbard Global Seed Vault",

         "I’ll keep it relatively brief.I think the idea has merit, but in practice, GMOs have become a way for big companies to make a lot of money by encouraging farmers to grow their patented products, which show optimal performance typically in a chemically-intensive growing environment. And, not coincidentally, those chemicals are also sold by the companies which sell the patented seeds. Sure, that doesn’t describe all GMOs, but it does describe many. Feel free to peruse the approved varieties listed below.GM Approval Database- ISAAA.orgPeople will argue that GMOs are the answer to meeting food production demands for a growing global population. They say that current methods without GMOs won’t satisfy that demand after a point. I don’t think this is the right way to solve that problem — its like coming up with a drug to deal with the side-effects of another drug, but ignoring the original cause.What’s really going on is a degradation of soil as a natural resource as a result of conventional agriculture. Throwing more intensive conventional agriculture at the problem to circumvent the lowered output of a degraded resource will only further degrade that resource over time. The better answer would be to seek to replenish that resource — to rebuild soil. And the better way to do that is through no-till agriculture which integrates pastured livestock management and crop rotation.Here is a relatively short video of Gabe Brown giving a TedTalk on no-till agriculture.If you have the time for a much longer talk, which includes comparison of soil composition and testing, yields, water usage, etc., you’ll find others by searching on YouTube.no-till farming gabe brownBecause of the amount of information presented, these are considerably longer.These are real farmers using systems that rely less or not at all on costly chemical inputs — including fertilizer. Their production has gone up, and by integrating several revenue streams into their farming, they are able to get a lot more from their land than if they adopted conventional repeat-monocropping with chemical additions and patented seed. And while they’re at it, they’re rebuilding soil and sequestering carbon. To me, this is a better path than tweaking crops to be able to grow after being sprayed with herbicides.I’m not against all GMOs at all. I think there is much good that can come of this tool — the GMO virus-resistant papaya comes to mind, which can be grown where Papaya Ringspot Virus is prevalent and would otherwise make raising this crop impossible. So before anyone replies to this answer with “GMOs are safe” or “you’re anti-science” please just don’t bother. That’s not what my angst against some of them (i.e. herbicide-resistant crops) is about. I just don’t think they’re all they’re hyped to be, nor are they the solution I’d prefer. We don’t need to tweak crops to produce better in degraded soil — we need to replenish the soil.ETA — I keep trying to copy the video URL to start at the beginning, but it doesn’t seem to be working. So if you click the videos, just drag it back to the beginning.",

Golden rice contains vitamin A precursors, and could virtually solve this problem.Humans have been selectively breeding plants since farming began. GMO is the logical extension of this.I do the grocery shopping in my family, and I try to watch for foods that are labeled “Non-GMO”, and then I don’t buy them. GMO products are safe and have the potential to greatly reduce world hunger, make food safer and more nutritious, and prevent some crops from being wiped out.I know this will not be a popular opinion with the conspiracy theory crowd, but in my view people who avoid GMO products do so out of fear of what they don’t understand.

         "Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \\more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.  If you want to make a change, do it with your wallet.Also, please keep in mind that most GMO crops are grown as feed for livestock.  So you must keep meat and dairy choices in mind when shopping, as well.",

         "You can take this question in one of two ways.  If you want to answer the question \\proactively label their GMO-containing foods?\\Justin Ma has a great answer.  I take the question to mean \\regulations that require them to label food that contains GMO-derived ingredients?\\I will focus on the United States, since that is where I am most familiar with the regulatory environment. Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \\The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do. Basically, the people who just claim that mandatory labeling laws would just \\For those who insist on providing information to consumers, there is a way you can do this: label your own products the way you want, and don't force others to do so.

         "Genetically Modified Organism. However what that means can be one of contention and you really need to ask who you are talking to. In many debates they are talking about intergenus genetic modification (of any process) especially those like Bt-Ready and Roundup-Ready. The anti-GMO debates tend to be mostly anti-Monsanto and focus on those types of modification.Some labeling laws have limited their scope to just this as well. Vermont's H.112 (Page on State) defines it as \\The organic standard is a bit more direct: \\Excluded methods. A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production. Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macroencapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology). Such methods do not include the use of traditional breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture.\\Code of Federal Regulations)Some researchers are trying to separate the terms and use other terms for what they do depending on whether they are doing their breeding outside taxonomic group or not. There are also some trying to argue the organic standard should take the difference in public opinion (breeding vs anti-monsanto) into account (see Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics, and the Future of Food: Pamela C. Ronald, R. W. Adamchak: 9780195393576: Amazon.com: Books)",

         "The same exact reason people are opposed to lab-grown diamonds: because an industry that makes immense profits from “organic” food has spent billions of dollars waging an immense propaganda campaign to whip people who don’t know how to do their research into a frenzy targeted at their business rivals.You even see some of that propaganda being repeated right here in the answers to this question, by people who sincerely believe whatever they’re told they’re saying.There’s a great example of this right here in this answer thread, by Tomaž Vargazon. I’m not picking on him; I generally find his content well-written and well-researched. But in this case, his answer is filled with misinformation and urban legend.For example, a common urban legend is that Monsanto sued farmers for accidental contamination, pursuing anyone with even a few stray plants in their fields so aggressively they bankrupted them.This story was invented by one man, a farmer in Indiana named Vernon Hugh Bowman. He collected soybean seeds from a grain elevator, planted them, then sprayed them with glyphosate to kill the ones that were not GM. He then planted his entire field with them.He tried claiming “accidental contamination” when he was sued, spinning a yarn that not even a jury of his peers believed. (Hint, when more than 95% of the plants on your farm are the same strain, that’s no accident, LOL.) He was convicted by a jury of his peers, but the story he spun stuck.I used to believe this story myself, just like Tomaž. Then someone challenged me to the same challenge I am about to make to Tomaž, and anyone else weho believes it:Name the farmers sued for this.All court cases in the US are public. If this happened, there should be plenty of examples. Cite cases. Name someone. You won’t be able to do it.In fact, Monsanto sent out people free of charge to clean out accidental contamination from any farmer who reported it.As for the “dangers” of glyphosate:Moreover, the company hid internal studies that showed their key moneymaking herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) wasn’t as safe as advertised. It was linked to an increase of cancer risk with gross overexposure.No.The overall incidence of cancer amongst people exposed to glyphosate is lower (yes, seriously!) than baseline.Lower. Not higher. Yes, seriously.The UN “study” that listed glyphosate as a “suspected carcinogen” is widely ridiculed in medical and scientific communities.So, why does this happen?$$$ money $$$Whenever you have a huge amount of money on the line, you will have a huge amount of money available for propaganda.People like to say Monsanto was this huge megacorporation. Actually, no, when it existed, it was kind of a pipsqueak.Organic foods, on the other hand, are an immense, fat-profit business. Sales of organic foods are more than triple Monsanto’s revenues.Organic food is huge, with much fatter profits than conventional or GM food, and organic food makers have poured billions of dollars over the yearsinto anti-GM propaganda—propaganda that well-meaning, otherwise intelligent people accept because it matches their bisaes and fears.I come to this from the position of a person who once believed as Tomaž and others do: Monsanto was an evil giant megacorporation, GM companies patented foods and that was bad, they bullied small farmers, and so on and so on.I started questioning that narrative when I started asking specific questions:How big is the GM food industry? How big is the organic food industry? Which is bigger?What farmers did Monsanto bully, specifically? What were their names? What were the case numbers? What farmers “lost their farms” because of Monsanto? Who were they?If GM food is bad because of food patents, then why did the first food patents get issued in the 1800s, before genetic engineering was a thing? Why are organic foods patented? (Spoilter: Yes, organic and conventional foods are also patented! Surprise! It’s amazing how many people legitimately don’t know this.)Once you start down these rabbit holes, you end up in a very different place than you started from.Why are so many people opposed to GM food? Because people are fearful about food in general, people have a purity fetish around food, and a lot of extremely profitable corporations spend a ton of money to make people frightened of GM food.Add in anti-corporate narratives and it becomes an easy sell.",

         "No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \\Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.",

The best part of GM crops is their high yield, good nutritional quality, a good shelf life, could be harvested in lesser time than the normal ones and the point of my interest- could be used to make edible vaccines (would'nt it be great- nutrition and vaccination all in a single shot- could be quite handy for poor countries and UN). Now on to the GM organisms. Till now, I have not known to any GMO. But I still know that they are being worked on. Their best use could be for MOLECULAR PHARMING (i.e obtaining vaccines and other biological agents like insulin from animal milk or any other by-product).

Music cannot be separated from the experience of listening to it in a way that can be owned.Recordings aren't even owned. They are licensed to you for limited uses by the copyright holders, in most cases, it'd the record label the artist has signed over their rights to.What we think of as the recordings we own on digital file, CD, phonograph, cassette, 8-track, or whatever -- these are merely containers for the recordings. We own the containers, but we do not own the recordings contained within them.It all boils down to this: what we think of as ownership of music is actually us paying for the right to access the music. In a world where the technological cost of providing global access to the entire history of recorded music is easily covered by charging a small fee or tax for access, the idea of music ownership will and should be considered anachronistic. Music is free. What we pay for is access.Of course, musicians need some sort of fair compensation to stimulate the production of music. This is the purpose of copyright in the first place. But musicians have never been fairly compensated for their music. Over the last few centuries, a microscopic minority of musicians became wealthy, while the music industry itself grew to a multibillion dollar enterprise. Increasingly, copyright is used by corporations to stifle technological innovation the maintain the status quo of musician exploitation and the lie of musical ownership. Prior to the invention of the recording, music could only be generated through a performance. There had to be musicians playing within earshot in order for one to experience music. Or, you had to play the song yourself. The economics were simple -- musicians enjoyed the support of their patrons, and later, the public became patron as live music flourished. The recording -- and the concept of music ownership -- shut down much of this burgeoning live music scene. The great irony is that after the recording dominated 20th century music, the 21st century brought the disruption of digital distribution, causing us to give new value the live performance and viewing the recording for what it really is -- a facsimile of a single performance. As such, we have a new generation of listeners and musicians that recognize music ownership is a capitalist illusion, access to music should be free like tap water (which we perceive as free but in reality is paid for as a utility), and live performance should be held up as the ultimate authentic music experience. This is why the concert industry is booming and record sales are plummeting.",

         "A genetically modified organism, is simply an organism who’s genes has been modified, as a result of human intervention by performing genetic engineering. This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is! And how/what’s that? We take the gene, that acts like a blueprint on how to make this hormone, from a healthy person. We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin. Soon, you have thousands of bacteria producing this hormone, and the quantity and quality of this insulin is good enough to become an economically viable manufacturing process, and that’s how you get insulin these days.So who was the GMO here? It was the bacteria. You manipulated the genetic material of the bacteria, so that it produced more insulin, which was for your own benefit, and made medicine cheaper.By the way, which kind of egg do you have?",

         "There is a general misconception that, for some reason, GMO food is bad for the health. There is no evidence that supports this. And no I don't work for a big company with vested interests in GMO and I've been a vegetarian for over twenty years so am not a trucks, guns and steaks kind of person either.GMO produced food I see as greener if it allows us to grow food on land that would otherwise be waste land. The reduction of pesticides, increase of crop nutrition and the increase of resistance of crops and yield per field all sound like healthy and green things to me. This runs so counter to the psuedo science out there that the common thing, if you say genetically modified crops are green, is to be accused of being a, er, plant. I'm pro green, pro science and it's lead me to knowing the concept of organic food being green and healthy and geneticially modified crops being ungreen and bad for the health, if anything, are backwards. Organic crops are often far from green to produce due to the resources needed to produce them. Organic meat, for example, has a much higher carbon footprint than non organic. It's like driving an SUV when you could be driving a small economical car. How is that green?",

         "I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control. This is not product that is being sold to help American families.The link below was deleted by the magazine after sharing. Here is the backup.China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be Buying (deleted after sharing)China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be BuyingThe Snack Food and Corn Syrup Lobbyist Shaping Guidelines for AmericansIf you’re consuming mostly genetically modified organisms into your diet, it means that you are not cooking your food from scratch. Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day. That is pretty sad.",

         "Neither in my opinion. Is the farmer a knowledgeable and honest grower? That’s the question of importance.Organic means that it has been grown without the application of synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. However, this does not prohibit the farmer from applying natural pesticides (pyrethrines) at high concentrations too close to harvest or applying manure from animals that were given high doses of antibiotics.The responsibility of what is good or not lies with the farmer. Not the product.If you follow the instructions of how to properly grow a crop from an agronomist it does not matter, which method or seed you use; organic or conventional farming, non-gmo or gmo. There are no nutritional differences measured from either type of crop cultivation. Flavor-wise it is better to buy from a farmer’s market than a supermarket, where they harvest immature vegetables and fruits, but nutritionally they are almost identical as well.Non-GMOs means that the product has been produced through traditional breeding methods which is a very long procedure (10–15 years). GMOs could have a disease resistance or drought resistance gene inside them from a related species or not, etc. This has absolutely no effect on you, unless we are talking about a toxin introduced into the plant, which companies avoid anyway doing that. Companies do not want dead or ill consumers. They want hungry and healthy consumers to keep buying their products. Period.So, to answer your question:I would consider more important Organic vs non-organic, although there is no practical difference between them for you. I just expect that Organic farmers would be more diligent as small-scale farmers about their concern for your food. GMOs vs non-GMOs just does not matter.Personally I would choose the farmer first and then my products.",

Soybeans. Cotton. Canola ( rapeseed). Alfalfa. There's more, but these will do fine for what we are talking about.\\n \\nNow we need to separate the crops into 2 subsets. Those crops that are self pollinated and those that are outcrossers. Selfers are plants that pollinate themselves by having the pollen drop into the stigma of the flower without needing outside help, like an insect or the wind, thus ensuring a tomato, or a chile pepper, or a wheat kernel. \\n \\n \\nOutcrossers need help to spread pollen. That head of broccoli needed mostly bees to help create it, or that ear of corn needed some strong wind to spread pollen.\\n \\nOk. So. Selfers- Soybeans. Cotton. \\n \\nOutcrossers.- Corn. Canola. Alfalfa. \\n \\nCrops that are selfers don't suffer from inbreeding depression, a term that means they lose their viability over time from having too little genetic diversity during the growing season. So saving seed from one tomato plant, one wheat plant, one bean plant is fine. That seed can be grown and resaved for a lifetime.\\n \\nOutcrossers aren't like that. They need lot's of genetic diversity, which to the farmer means they  grow a lot of plants. One broccoli plant? No way. One carrot plant, one corn plant, one canola plant? No. Think at least 500 to start, and no less than 100 to finish. They need pollination from a large population of plants. Without this, the seed is very poor, genetically bottlenecked and usually unfit for next generational use. \\n \\nOk?\\n \\nNow let's further separate these crops into 2 types. Open pollinated and hybrid. \\n \\nOP crops are old fashioned crops that our grandparents and parents grew, including heirloom varieties. If you grow, for example, an heirloom tomato, and decide to pull some seeds out of one of the tomatoes, it will \\hybrid vigor, and clearly outshines the parents.

         "I have trouble with the terminology, but the concepts are clear.GMO, or genetically modified organisms, are the essence of agriculture. For thousands of years, farmers, agronomists, plant scientists have used plant and animal breeding to manipulate the genetic makeup of the foods we eat. That is a good thing.However, GMOs as they are developed today, uses recombinant DNA manipulation to alter the attributes of the plants. As a result, it is possible to introduce changes that we would never see in nature (i.e. introduction of animal characteristics into plant material). While that’s not necessarily bad, we also greatly reduce the time it takes to see the changes in the material, and therefore we can’t fully investigate the unintended consequences of our manipulations. Every technological innovation has risks of unintended consequences, but genetic manipulation can have broad, catastrophic impacts. It’s kind of like nuclear power generation: it’s a great thing when everything is fine, and failure may be very rare, but the impacts can be huge. I advocate continuing research, but proceeding slowly. I also believe in detailed labelling to enable consumers to make their own choices.Organic foods fall into a different category. The term “organic” is meaningless and requires significant explanation in order to be useful for consumers. I do not believe that inorganic fertilizers are “bad” and I do not believe that all herbicides and pesticides are bad. Again, it’s a matter of really looking into the specific practices of cultivation. That’s one reason why I do agree with buying from local producers: the consumer has the ability to find out exactly how something was produced and to talk to the producer.",

In fact, there's a list: Studies with independent fundingThe conclusions are clear: no negative effects. GMO's are just as nutritious as non-GMO's (except when they are designed to be even more nutritious, like Golden Rice) and cause no health problems. Here is a literature review of these results, and another assessment of GE food safety here.Note that studies do exist saying GMO's are bad… but you asked for good ones. Studies existed saying vaccines cause autism and that cigarettes are harmless, but those studies were flawed and a few were retracted. It is important to 1) not let a single study trump the dozens of studies that contradict it, 2) not confuse opinion papers with actual science research, and 3) be sure that any study has valid controls, a large sample size, no conflict of interest (be it big-Agritech or big-Organic, both of which have millions to burn), and is otherwise scientifically sound. A study that tried to show GMO corn gives rats cancer, for example, was debunked when scientists pointed out they used cancer-prone rats in the study, who would have gotten sick even if they were fed organic food, or nothing at all.Ultimately, while political and economic opposition to GMO's may be valid, the science is clear that they are safe. Scientists are disappointed that anti-GMO activists, like anti-vaccine activists and climate change deniers, are twisting the facts or denying overwhelming evidence to lie to their constituency and get political points.",

I feel I’ve been quite good at it, my current role is fine, I’m just feeling a little burnt out on the manufacturing environments, audits, etc. Wondering if trying a different industry would help. I don’t think I’m exactly cut out for the R&D side of things in the food world although I have enjoyed working adjacent with them on projects. \n\nIn reading job descriptions, it seems like there’s some fundamental similarities between the industries like with FDA, cGMPs, ISO, quality systems, but a different side of the coin with the product type and regulation. Is it really that similar to food to be able to learn with only a background in food and food science up to this point? Feels like it would be a little overkill to try to do a Master’s or further education just to move to what seems like a fairly adjacent field/industry. Maybe more of a certificate or a couple of courses? Wondering what others’ experiences have been.",

         "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm finishing up my PhD in Food Science this summer. For background, I went straight from earning my B.S. in Chemistry into a Master’s in Food Science, then rolled straight into the PhD program—so I’ve had no industry experience until recently.\n\nAbout a year ago, my advisor began prioritizing other students, and I was left running the lab, managing research projects, and mentoring newer students academically. It got to the point where I decided to start applying for jobs. I landed an interview at a major CPG company for an R&D scientist contractor role. Unbeknownst to me, the hiring manager was a close friend of my advisor, and they called my advisor behind the scenes (I hadn't listed them as a reference), which blew my cover. Ironically, that seemed to make my advisor finally start paying attention and push me toward graduating on time.\n\nI’ve now been at this big CPG company for 7 months. I’ve had great performance—bringing in internal testing capabilities projected to save the company millions annually. Despite that, I’m still a contractor, and while I survived recent layoffs, the company isn’t doing well financially.\n\nRecently, they opened up several Associate Scientist roles in my department. Although the title says “Associate,” the job responsibilities are equivalent to Scientist—HR downgraded the title due to FTE limits. Oddly enough, while I'm being offered this downgraded Associate role, technicians in the same department are being promoted to “Associate Scientist” titles but will remain in technician-level roles. For context, this company typically offers PhDs a Scientist or Senior Scientist position. HR admitted I’m overqualified but said I can still get the Associate role—just with a starting salary and no eligibility for promotion for 2–3 years.\n\nSo, I started applying externally. I got an interview and then an offer from another major CPG company nearby. Originally, I interviewed for a **Scientist** role with a $95K salary and 5% bonus. However, HR called and said I’m “severely underqualified” for the Scientist title but they still want to offer me the job—as an **Associate Scientist** at $75K. I pushed back, saying I don’t believe I’m underqualified and asked for $80K. They responded that even $80K was too high. I’m confused because this is the same role I was interviewed for with the same responsibilities and originally offered $95K.\n\nI can’t tell if I’m being lowballed, or if this is just how things are right now due to the economy. I know other fresh PhDs who walked into Senior Scientist roles right out of grad school. I have strong analytical experience (GC, HPLC, method development, etc.) and have delivered measurable impact at my current job.\n\nIs anyone else going through something similar? Am I missing something here? Would love to hear other perspectives—especially from folks in food science, chemistry, or related CPG roles.",

Expecting to graduate after the Fall 2026 semester. I would love to end up in product development and or R&D in that area. ",

Are there any other degrees I can get, in order to gain an entry in the food industry(preferably in product development,R&D, QC/QA), something along the lines of BS biochem, biotech, microbiology etc?

         "Hi all! I’ve been a long time lurker but need some insight from the food science world. \n\nI have a BS in Biochemical Engineering and after working in pharma/biotech as an Researcher I’ve realized the industry is not for me - not super stoked about being a lab rat and little jaded by the industry (granted I understand every industry has its flaws). I stepped away from biotech and started working as a chef/line cook which has really sparked my passion for working with food. While I love being surrounded by food, you guessed it, the restaurant industry is too demanding and not sustainable for a long term career. Since, I have been considering going back to school and getting a masters in food science but want to get some insight to know if this is the best career move. The market is shit right now and have been trying to make the switch to a company more related to food science and have not been successful. \n\nWhile exploring various cooking careers I have noticed I enjoy working closely with people - not interested in being in a lab at least in the long run. What career choices in food science have this feature and is getting a masters useful to accomplish this? \n\nThank you thank you  I appreciate any insight !!!!\n",

Also I covered them in cocoa powder mixed with sugar and water - the consistency was chocolate like and so was the taste (but is was healthier) I put them in the freezer and the ”chocolate” was perfect, but the protein bar was like stone, so I put it in the fridge overnight and the chocolate totally melted. \nI want to recreate the texture of typical quest bars.

I've recently taken an interest in food science, and am curious if it would be worth applying for graduate schools with my background. I graduated from a mid tier state school with a bachelor's in nutrition science in 2016. I don't remember my exact GPA but I believe it was somewhere around 3.5. After graduating I worked for a local organic farming company. I grew food and provided nutrition/farming education at school & community gardens as well as for home owners needing assistance with their personal vegetable gardens. I've also worked as a product specialist for a supplement company (basically people call in and ask questions about the products). \n\nI have looked into a few programs & I would definitely need to take some prerequisite classes that were not required for my nutrition degree, but before I do that I'd like to see if there's even any hope for me or if my background is just too unrelated/not spectacular enough to be accepted into a program. I do not have any research experience btw.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone willing to take the time to read this/offer their opinion. ",

         "I just started a new job as a QA Tech for a small food company that makes/packages a couple different food products. I have never worked in the food industry before. During the interview process my manager mentioned that I would be expected to work some weekend days 5 times a year. That seemed reasonable to me. The schedule I was contracted with was for 8 hour work day. The first week on the job myself and my trainer stayed late every day, about 5 hours of overtime total that week. My trainer told me that 5 hours of overtime a week is actually the low end of what they usually work. She said she works an average of 5-15 hours of overtime a week. Is this normal in food production? I was taken aback when she told me that. I have a degree in Biotech and I took this job because I was interested in transitioning to food science related jobs. Now I'm not sure if this  path is for me. I don't mind an extra 30 mins a day, but 15 hours of overtime plus some weekends sounds pretty intense. I would love to hear from QA food people about their experiences. ",

I’m currently a third year studying Cognitive Science and as much as I love my major I’m planning on taking a gap year to consider my options which includes taking a jab at food science. My school has a food science minor however its coursework consists of a more environmental, sustainable approach which doesn’t really suite my interests of wanting to do quality assurance and product development. After this school year is over I plan on completing a certificate for biotech at my local community which I hope increases my likelihood of getting an internship at a food company. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice or pointers as to what kinds of activities, certificates, or even volunteer work I should get involved in?\n\nI appreciate everyone’s responses :)",

         "(brief intro but the list of schools is detailed below) \n\nHii I am posting on this sub looking for some advice from anyone who has gone through this similar process of choosing which university to go to. I have just graduated highschool and while I haven’t had any formal exposure to foodscience I enjoy both biotech and food industries and see myself possibly dedicating my future yo such areas. (Specially when it comes to R&D, I was also looking for minoring in some sort of business/finance field to complement)\n\nHowever, the issue of starting from zero and without guidance is the uncertainty. I understand foodscience is a field of many disciplines but I worry some of the majors I applied to would make it hard to make my way into it. I anyone wants to give their opinion on the options I have to study I would be so grateful :)\n\nThank you!       Options are:\n\nUCLA molecular, celular and developmental biology (my parent’s liking due to quality of living)\n\nBerkeley genetics and plant biology\n\nUC Davis Biotechnology \n\nUIUC plant biotechnology\n\nWashU Molecular Biology and Biochem\n\nI was also offered a Transfer Option to Cornell and wanted to add it just in case, but I will still have to choose a school.",

I'm now seriously hating my job and need to make moves towards a change even if it's inconvenient and scary.\n\nI have a PhD in Analytical Chemistry and 4 years experience in the Pharma industry doing Analytical Development (an R&D department). The work is occasionally challenging but not in ways that I find stimulating. I do not care at all about the industry or the product; I find drug development uninteresting. I also want to work more in product development and research (what I do now is glorified quality control and regulatory).\n\nFood is something I actively find interesting and is something I nerd out on all the time (which I never do with biotech). However, I have no idea where to start in terms of learning about the various R&D roles available and what I need to do in order to get my foot in the door. I got some generous advice from an IFS spokesperson I connected with but I'm growing increasingly wary of the IFS cert that was recommended and looking for more opinions. IFT also has other resources but are all behind expensive paywalls, which automatically puts me on guard.\n\nSpecifically here are are my questions:\n\n* Where can I learn about the various aspects and steps of food science/tech R&D?\n   * What is the typical R&D life cycle of a food product?\n* As a PhD with somewhat relevant experience in a related industry, what would I need to get my first food science job? A certification? Another graduate degree?\n* How do I build a network when I have no connections in the food industry? I was planning on attending conferences, but that's out of the question at the moment.",

During my studies, I opted to take a broad course work so I atleast have knowledge in all aspects: food product development, marketing, microbiology and hygiene, and chemistry. Apart from the normal classes, I took on several special projects about microbiology and food chemistry as I really enjoy the process of lab work + writing scientific reports. Of course I am fully aware I can work under food safety, quality assurance, product development and nutrition (basically the food industry, biotech industry). But right the job market is so competitive that there are so few openings. Are there any other industries that I can look into? Also, I have zero job experience as I immediately continued from undergrad to grad school so Im a little bit lost.\n\nThanks so much for your time! :-)",

Anyway, I'm just really curious about this.\n\nObviously in certain cases you will have inherent properties of a food that make it taste the way it tastes (e.g. a compound that both stimulates the tastebuds and drives another process in the food, such as an Lemon's flavour and it being sour), and I understand as well that physical texture is a big part of taste too, and that certain genetic pathways are intertwined, \n\nHowever, in many cases flavour is dictated by specific compounds produced from the food. Is it not possible for specific cases to just genetically engineer these compound production into a new fruit or whatever. Say, make a banana that has had all the flavour metabolic pathways punched out and replaced with the metabolic pathways that produce the strawberry flavour?",

My ideal job is to work as a product developer and would really appreciate any tips or advice anyone can provide as in what I could do in the following year to increase my chances of landing a job as one. \n\nAs a little background, I got an undergraduate in Biotech. I got solid bases on biochem and microbiology along with molecular biology techniques. I got no industry experience (yeah, I know) but worked as a lab teacher for a year. (This might be relevant in atleast showing I could get and keep a job.)\n\nSome things I'm doing/got done during my first MSc year:\n* My thesis is on developing a functional bread.\n* Got plenty of experience in food analyzes techniques.\n* Got an accepted paper and another manuscript under review.\n* Attended full semester courses on Food Chemistry, Food Tech, Sensorial Evaluation, Statistics, among others.\n* In November will attend a congress with high industry attendance in order to network like crazy, as well as presenting some results.\n*Attended several workshops in meat and dairy food production on a lab scale.\n*Learning R programming at the moment.\n\n\nIf it matters, this is not in the USA. Hope it all makes sense, English is not my first language. \nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: Sorry for the format, during writing and editing it's much better. I don't know how to fix it. ",

         "Hey guys,\n\nTo cut a long story short, I'm originally from Madrid, and I'm trying to find a job in Spain in the food science industry. I studied chemistry and biochemistry in the US, got a PhD in protein biophysics in the UK, and I'm currently a research associate at a world-class institution (also in the UK). I have no regulated experience in the food industry, but I'm a huge nerd about it and have read plenty of books on it and practiced at home (I commandeered an old immersion circulator and other equipment from lab). Plus from my degrees I have pleeenty of experience with the instrumentation and things like protein denaturation and whatnot.\n\nYou would think that with these credentials it wouldn't be so incredibly hard to at least get an interview, but I have had no luck whatsoever. I have attempted to contact the Basque Culinary Center repeatedly but nothing has panned out.\nI have exhausted all the contacts I have in these field, and have nothing to show for it. I really, really like it, but it seems impossible to get a job on it unless I move to the US or northern Europe. Do you guys have any clues on what to try next? I really don't want to have to settle for a job in the pharma/biotech industry.\n\nI would much rather end up in Madrid, but I'm open to France or Italy, I really don't think I can stay away from southern europe after 9 years abroad...\n\nThanks a bunch",

         "Hi there. I have recently stepped off the \"organic\" food craze and have decided to just eat conventionally. Growing up I always ate convential fruit and vegetables or local ones without any issues back home in Beirut. However ever since coming to the West people here are obsessed with organic foods and I don't think it's warranted considering all the research about how safe conventional produce is.\n\nThat being said, I still have no clue why ginger is more yellow and more potent when organic and am looking for a true, scientific explanation to ease my paranoia. I can also say the same about garlic and even celery. \n\nMuch stronger in flavor when organic. And apples also don't have a soapy taste when organic. Those are pretty much the only foods where I have actually noticed a difference.\n\nSometimes organic veggies taste bad and sour whereas other times they taste better.\n\nIs this all really due to variety, freshness, or storage? Or is there a deeper reason for this?\n\nWould appreciate any advice from someone with a background in chemistry, food science or even agriculture.\n\nThanks!",

         "Originally posted in r/chemistry but it was suggested I get opinions here. I extracted Urease enzyme from soybeans by soaking and blending soybeans in distilled water and filtering through coffee filters. The liquid was still cloudy and I wanted to clear it up further. I am a chem noob, and had a theory I could mix in some NaHCO3 baking soda to precipitate out son ions because I know many ionic compounds with carbonate are not soluble, leaving soluble urease in the supernatant, which I could decant. I was surprised to see how well this actually worked, but now I am not sure if it worked for the reasons I thought it might. Why did the addition of baking soda cause all the organic soybean matter to settle? (Left is with baking soda, right is without)   \n  \nSome of the theories I got in r/chemistry are:  \n1. increase of pH from baking soda caused the emulsion to break forcing the organic particles to settle  \n2. increase of pH made some things insoluble that were soluble at lower pH  \n3. [salting out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salting_out) with the NaHCO3 caused  proteins to precipitate out due to high ionic strength of the solution  \n\nAny more ideas or intuition to understand this would be so awesome!   \n",

         "Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \\more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.  If you want to make a change, do it with your wallet.Also, please keep in mind that most GMO crops are grown as feed for livestock.  So you must keep meat and dairy choices in mind when shopping, as well.",

         "You can take this question in one of two ways.  If you want to answer the question \\proactively label their GMO-containing foods?\\Justin Ma has a great answer.  I take the question to mean \\regulations that require them to label food that contains GMO-derived ingredients?\\I will focus on the United States, since that is where I am most familiar with the regulatory environment. Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \\The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do. Basically, the people who just claim that mandatory labeling laws would just \\For those who insist on providing information to consumers, there is a way you can do this: label your own products the way you want, and don't force others to do so.

         "Genetically Modified Organism. However what that means can be one of contention and you really need to ask who you are talking to. In many debates they are talking about intergenus genetic modification (of any process) especially those like Bt-Ready and Roundup-Ready. The anti-GMO debates tend to be mostly anti-Monsanto and focus on those types of modification.Some labeling laws have limited their scope to just this as well. Vermont's H.112 (Page on State) defines it as \\The organic standard is a bit more direct: \\Excluded methods. A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production. Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macroencapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology). Such methods do not include the use of traditional breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture.\\Code of Federal Regulations)Some researchers are trying to separate the terms and use other terms for what they do depending on whether they are doing their breeding outside taxonomic group or not. There are also some trying to argue the organic standard should take the difference in public opinion (breeding vs anti-monsanto) into account (see Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics, and the Future of Food: Pamela C.

         "The same exact reason people are opposed to lab-grown diamonds: because an industry that makes immense profits from “organic” food has spent billions of dollars waging an immense propaganda campaign to whip people who don’t know how to do their research into a frenzy targeted at their business rivals.You even see some of that propaganda being repeated right here in the answers to this question, by people who sincerely believe whatever they’re told they’re saying.There’s a great example of this right here in this answer thread, by Tomaž Vargazon. I’m not picking on him; I generally find his content well-written and well-researched. But in this case, his answer is filled with misinformation and urban legend.For example, a common urban legend is that Monsanto sued farmers for accidental contamination, pursuing anyone with even a few stray plants in their fields so aggressively they bankrupted them.This story was invented by one man, a farmer in Indiana named Vernon Hugh Bowman. He collected soybean seeds from a grain elevator, planted them, then sprayed them with glyphosate to kill the ones that were not GM. He then planted his entire field with them.He tried claiming “accidental contamination” when he was sued, spinning a yarn that not even a jury of his peers believed. (Hint, when more than 95% of the plants on your farm are the same strain, that’s no accident, LOL.) He was convicted by a jury of his peers, but the story he spun stuck.I used to believe this story myself, just like Tomaž. Then someone challenged me to the same challenge I am about to make to Tomaž, and anyone else weho believes it:Name the farmers sued for this.All court cases in the US are public. If this happened, there should be plenty of examples. Cite cases. Name someone. You won’t be able to do it.In fact, Monsanto sent out people free of charge to clean out accidental contamination from any farmer who reported it.As for the “dangers” of glyphosate:Moreover, the company hid internal studies that showed their key moneymaking herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) wasn’t as safe as advertised. It was linked to an increase of cancer risk with gross overexposure.No.The overall incidence of cancer amongst people exposed to glyphosate is lower (yes, seriously!) than baseline.Lower. Not higher. Yes, seriously.The UN “study” that listed glyphosate as a “suspected carcinogen” is widely ridiculed in medical and scientific communities.So, why does this happen?$$$ money $$$Whenever you have a huge amount of money on the line, you will have a huge amount of money available for propaganda.People like to say Monsanto was this huge megacorporation. Actually, no, when it existed, it was kind of a pipsqueak.Organic foods, on the other hand, are an immense, fat-profit business. Sales of organic foods are more than triple Monsanto’s revenues.Organic food is huge, with much fatter profits than conventional or GM food, and organic food makers have poured billions of dollars over the yearsinto anti-GM propaganda—propaganda that well-meaning, otherwise intelligent people accept because it matches their bisaes and fears.I come to this from the position of a person who once believed as Tomaž and others do: Monsanto was an evil giant megacorporation, GM companies patented foods and that was bad, they bullied small farmers, and so on and so on.I started questioning that narrative when I started asking specific questions:How big is the GM food industry? How big is the organic food industry? Which is bigger?What farmers did Monsanto bully, specifically? What were their names? What were the case numbers? What farmers “lost their farms” because of Monsanto? Who were they?If GM food is bad because of food patents, then why did the first food patents get issued in the 1800s, before genetic engineering was a thing? Why are organic foods patented? (Spoilter: Yes, organic and conventional foods are also patented! Surprise! It’s amazing how many people legitimately don’t know this.)Once you start down these rabbit holes, you end up in a very different place than you started from.Why are so many people opposed to GM food? Because people are fearful about food in general, people have a purity fetish around food, and a lot of extremely profitable corporations spend a ton of money to make people frightened of GM food.Add in anti-corporate narratives and it becomes an easy sell.",

         "No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \\Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.",

         "Music.Music is what happens when a song is played -- either a performance or a recording of a performance. Music cannot be separated from the experience of listening to it in a way that can be owned.Recordings aren't even owned. They are licensed to you for limited uses by the copyright holders, in most cases, it'd the record label the artist has signed over their rights to.What we think of as the recordings we own on digital file, CD, phonograph, cassette, 8-track, or whatever -- these are merely containers for the recordings. We own the containers, but we do not own the recordings contained within them.It all boils down to this: what we think of as ownership of music is actually us paying for the right to access the music. In a world where the technological cost of providing global access to the entire history of recorded music is easily covered by charging a small fee or tax for access, the idea of music ownership will and should be considered anachronistic. Music is free. What we pay for is access.Of course, musicians need some sort of fair compensation to stimulate the production of music. This is the purpose of copyright in the first place. But musicians have never been fairly compensated for their music. Over the last few centuries, a microscopic minority of musicians became wealthy, while the music industry itself grew to a multibillion dollar enterprise. Increasingly, copyright is used by corporations to stifle technological innovation the maintain the status quo of musician exploitation and the lie of musical ownership. Prior to the invention of the recording, music could only be generated through a performance. There had to be musicians playing within earshot in order for one to experience music. Or, you had to play the song yourself. The economics were simple -- musicians enjoyed the support of their patrons, and later, the public became patron as live music flourished. The recording -- and the concept of music ownership -- shut down much of this burgeoning live music scene. The great irony is that after the recording dominated 20th century music, the 21st century brought the disruption of digital distribution, causing us to give new value the live performance and viewing the recording for what it really is -- a facsimile of a single performance. As such, we have a new generation of listeners and musicians that recognize music ownership is a capitalist illusion, access to music should be free like tap water (which we perceive as free but in reality is paid for as a utility), and live performance should be held up as the ultimate authentic music experience. This is why the concert industry is booming and record sales are plummeting.",

         "A genetically modified organism, is simply an organism who’s genes has been modified, as a result of human intervention by performing genetic engineering. This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is! And how/what’s that? We take the gene, that acts like a blueprint on how to make this hormone, from a healthy person. We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin. Soon, you have thousands of bacteria producing this hormone, and the quantity and quality of this insulin is good enough to become an economically viable manufacturing process, and that’s how you get insulin these days.So who was the GMO here? It was the bacteria. You manipulated the genetic material of the bacteria, so that it produced more insulin, which was for your own benefit, and made medicine cheaper.By the way, which kind of egg do you have?",

         "There is a general misconception that, for some reason, GMO food is bad for the health. There is no evidence that supports this. And no I don't work for a big company with vested interests in GMO and I've been a vegetarian for over twenty years so am not a trucks, guns and steaks kind of person either.GMO produced food I see as greener if it allows us to grow food on land that would otherwise be waste land. The reduction of pesticides, increase of crop nutrition and the increase of resistance of crops and yield per field all sound like healthy and green things to me. This runs so counter to the psuedo science out there that the common thing, if you say genetically modified crops are green, is to be accused of being a, er, plant. I'm pro green, pro science and it's lead me to knowing the concept of organic food being green and healthy and geneticially modified crops being ungreen and bad for the health, if anything, are backwards. Organic crops are often far from green to produce due to the resources needed to produce them. Organic meat, for example, has a much higher carbon footprint than non organic. It's like driving an SUV when you could be driving a small economical car. How is that green?",

         "I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control. This is not product that is being sold to help American families.The link below was deleted by the magazine after sharing. Here is the backup.China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be Buying (deleted after sharing)China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be BuyingThe Snack Food and Corn Syrup Lobbyist Shaping Guidelines for AmericansIf you’re consuming mostly genetically modified organisms into your diet, it means that you are not cooking your food from scratch. Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day. That is pretty sad.",

         "Neither in my opinion. Is the farmer a knowledgeable and honest grower? That’s the question of importance.Organic means that it has been grown without the application of synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. However, this does not prohibit the farmer from applying natural pesticides (pyrethrines) at high concentrations too close to harvest or applying manure from animals that were given high doses of antibiotics.The responsibility of what is good or not lies with the farmer. Not the product.If you follow the instructions of how to properly grow a crop from an agronomist it does not matter, which method or seed you use; organic or conventional farming, non-gmo or gmo. There are no nutritional differences measured from either type of crop cultivation. Flavor-wise it is better to buy from a farmer’s market than a supermarket, where they harvest immature vegetables and fruits, but nutritionally they are almost identical as well.Non-GMOs means that the product has been produced through traditional breeding methods which is a very long procedure (10–15 years). GMOs could have a disease resistance or drought resistance gene inside them from a related species or not, etc. This has absolutely no effect on you, unless we are talking about a toxin introduced into the plant, which companies avoid anyway doing that. Companies do not want dead or ill consumers. They want hungry and healthy consumers to keep buying their products. Period.So, to answer your question:I would consider more important Organic vs non-organic, although there is no practical difference between them for you. I just expect that Organic farmers would be more diligent as small-scale farmers about their concern for your food. GMOs vs non-GMOs just does not matter.Personally I would choose the farmer first and then my products.",

Soybeans. Cotton. Canola ( rapeseed). Alfalfa. There's more, but these will do fine for what we are talking about.\\n \\nNow we need to separate the crops into 2 subsets. Those crops that are self pollinated and those that are outcrossers. Selfers are plants that pollinate themselves by having the pollen drop into the stigma of the flower without needing outside help, like an insect or the wind, thus ensuring a tomato, or a chile pepper, or a wheat kernel. \\n \\n \\nOutcrossers need help to spread pollen. That head of broccoli needed mostly bees to help create it, or that ear of corn needed some strong wind to spread pollen.\\n \\nOk. So. Selfers- Soybeans. Cotton. \\n \\nOutcrossers.- Corn. Canola. Alfalfa. \\n \\nCrops that are selfers don't suffer from inbreeding depression, a term that means they lose their viability over time from having too little genetic diversity during the growing season. So saving seed from one tomato plant, one wheat plant, one bean plant is fine. That seed can be grown and resaved for a lifetime.\\n \\nOutcrossers aren't like that. They need lot's of genetic diversity, which to the farmer means they  grow a lot of plants. One broccoli plant? No way. One carrot plant, one corn plant, one canola plant? No. Think at least 500 to start, and no less than 100 to finish. They need pollination from a large population of plants. Without this, the seed is very poor, genetically bottlenecked and usually unfit for next generational use. \\n \\nOk?\\n \\nNow let's further separate these crops into 2 types. Open pollinated and hybrid. \\n \\nOP crops are old fashioned crops that our grandparents and parents grew, including heirloom varieties. If you grow, for example, an heirloom tomato, and decide to pull some seeds out of one of the tomatoes, it will \\hybrid vigor, and clearly outshines the parents.

         "I have trouble with the terminology, but the concepts are clear.GMO, or genetically modified organisms, are the essence of agriculture. For thousands of years, farmers, agronomists, plant scientists have used plant and animal breeding to manipulate the genetic makeup of the foods we eat. That is a good thing.However, GMOs as they are developed today, uses recombinant DNA manipulation to alter the attributes of the plants. As a result, it is possible to introduce changes that we would never see in nature (i.e. introduction of animal characteristics into plant material). While that’s not necessarily bad, we also greatly reduce the time it takes to see the changes in the material, and therefore we can’t fully investigate the unintended consequences of our manipulations. Every technological innovation has risks of unintended consequences, but genetic manipulation can have broad, catastrophic impacts. It’s kind of like nuclear power generation: it’s a great thing when everything is fine, and failure may be very rare, but the impacts can be huge. I advocate continuing research, but proceeding slowly. I also believe in detailed labelling to enable consumers to make their own choices.Organic foods fall into a different category. The term “organic” is meaningless and requires significant explanation in order to be useful for consumers. I do not believe that inorganic fertilizers are “bad” and I do not believe that all herbicides and pesticides are bad. Again, it’s a matter of really looking into the specific practices of cultivation. That’s one reason why I do agree with buying from local producers: the consumer has the ability to find out exactly how something was produced and to talk to the producer.",

In fact, there's a list: Studies with independent fundingThe conclusions are clear: no negative effects. GMO's are just as nutritious as non-GMO's (except when they are designed to be even more nutritious, like Golden Rice) and cause no health problems. Here is a literature review of these results, and another assessment of GE food safety here.Note that studies do exist saying GMO's are bad… but you asked for good ones. Studies existed saying vaccines cause autism and that cigarettes are harmless, but those studies were flawed and a few were retracted. It is important to 1) not let a single study trump the dozens of studies that contradict it, 2) not confuse opinion papers with actual science research, and 3) be sure that any study has valid controls, a large sample size, no conflict of interest (be it big-Agritech or big-Organic, both of which have millions to burn), and is otherwise scientifically sound. A study that tried to show GMO corn gives rats cancer, for example, was debunked when scientists pointed out they used cancer-prone rats in the study, who would have gotten sick even if they were fed organic food, or nothing at all.Ultimately, while political and economic opposition to GMO's may be valid, the science is clear that they are safe. Scientists are disappointed that anti-GMO activists, like anti-vaccine activists and climate change deniers, are twisting the facts or denying overwhelming evidence to lie to their constituency and get political points.",

There is no way to grow foods entirely without pesticides. Plants themselves make pesticides. The goal is to make the plant toxic so that nobody else will eat it (except maybe the requisite pollinator of seed-spreader). \\The good reasons revolve around trying to grow the plant in an environment close to the one it evolved in. This involves a whole ecosystem: other plants, natural predators, a lot more land per plant than industrial farming.

         "The only proven health issues with GMOs are possible allergic reactions. But those occur with non GMO foods too. The health and environmental benefits of GMO foods are substantial: higher nutrition levels, fewer inputs(fertilizer and pesticides) higher yields, longer season, wider range of growing areas, etc. I wii cite a couple of real, not theoretical, examples.In the western US the Pink Bollworm (PBW) is a big threat to cotton. It only feeds on cotton and okra, a close relative. The adult moth lays eggs on the cotton boll (fruiting structure that holds the seed and lint fibers) When the eggs hatch the larva (worm) eats its way into the boll, heading for the seed, which holds the protein it needs to survive. The worm is vulnerable to chemical control for 2–3 days, then it is too far into the boll to kill. Once the worm reaches the seed the boll, and lint is ruined. Some growers try to time spraying by trapping and counting the moth flights, picking the peak times to spray. You can never get all of the worms or moths unless you spray every night, which is cost prohibitive and environmentally un sound. A recent GMO discovery has for the most part solved this problem. Plant breeders have found way to “inject” cotton with a bacteria, Bacillus Thuringensis, into cotton. The seed of that inoculated cotton actually has the bacteria in it, which spreads throughout the plant as it grows. The PBW hatches and feeds on any part of the plant and it ingests the BT, which causes the worm to die. As a result 6 to 10 pesticide applications are eliminated. That means the cotton growing regions use thousands of pounds less pesticides every season. Did I mention the Bacillus Thuringensis is certified Organic?Another example of GMO benefits is Golden Rice. Some islands in the West Pacific Rim have been growing rice for generations with low levels of micronutrients. Beta Carotene- the orange in carrots- is needed in the diets of children aged 6 months to 10 years for Vitamin A production, which is responsible for eye development and general health. A million children die each year due to vitamin deficiencies and 500,000 children lose their eyesight due to lack of Vitamin A. After nine years of research Golden Rice emerged. It has higher levels of Beta Carotene in the grain kernals, so much so that it has an orange-gold color. Two cups of Golden Rice a day provides all of the Beta Carotene needed to maintain good eyesight That’s why your Mom kept saying “Eat your carrots, you’ve never seen a blind rabbit have you?”Golden Rice production and distribution has has been hampered by some governments who delay its use or stop it with excessive regulation. BT cotton has been criticized as being “dangerous” or a product of “Frankenfarming.” But GMO agriculture can lessen fertilizer, pesticide, or even water use. Genetically Modified plants can provide more food that is more nutrient laden, stays fresh longer, and is easier to transport.American researcher Norman Borlaug was the father of the first Green Revolution in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. During that time the world’s population grew by 100%, but food production grew by 150%, proving the 1700s economist Malthus terribly wrong, and the 1900s ag economist Boserup thankfully right. GMOs represent the next Green Revolution.",

         "An important key to understanding why Europe and the United States have chosen to regulate identical technologies in such a dissimilar fashion has to do with recent changes in politics of risk regulation in Europe. From the 1960s through the mid 1980s, the regulation of health, safety and environmental risks was generally stricter in the United States than in Europe. Since the mid 1980s, the obverse has often been the case: a wide array of European consumer and environmental regulations, including those governing GMOs, are now more restrictive than in the United States. In a number of important respects, European regulatory politics and policies over the last fifteen years resemble those of the United States between the late 1960s and the mid 1980s. They are often politicized, highly contentious and characterized by a suspicion of science and a mistrust of both government and industry. By contrast, the US regulation of GMOs resembles the European regulatory style of the 1970s: regulators have worked cooperatively with industry and been supportive of technological innovation, while non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have enjoyed little access to the policy process.That was from a very comprehensive paper on the subject of why the EU regulates GMOs more than the U.S. In short it has more to to with politics and risk aversion than actual good science.Please read the full paper to understand this more fully. Please follow my link.The Regulation of GMOs in Europe and the United States: A Case-Study of Contemporary European Regulatory PoliticsIn other words, most GMO bans or regulations are politically motivated and have nothing to do with science.What do most of the world’s scientific organizations have to say about it, including European.AAASThe American Association for the Advancement of Science is an international non-profit organization and serves some 261 affiliated societies and academies of science.“The science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe”.AMAThe premier body of physicians in the United States.“There is no scientific justification for special labeling of genetically modified foods.Bioengineered foods have been consumed for close to 20 years, and during that time, no overt consequences on human health have been reported and/or substantiated in the peer-reviewed literature.”WHOThe World Health Organization (WHO) is the direction and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.“No effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of GM foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved.ECThe European Commission (EC) is the executive body of the European Union“The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs are no more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.”NASThe National Academy of Sciences is a non-profit organization in the United Staes. It is the premier scientific body of the United States.“To date more than 98 million acres of genetically modified crops have been grown worldwide. No evidence of human health problems associated with the ingestion of these crops or resulting food products have been identified.”The Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities is an umbrella organization for eight german academies of sciences and humanities.“In consuming food derived from GM plants approved in the EU and in the USA, the risk is in no way higher than in the consumption of food from conventionally grown plants. On the contrary, in some cases food from GM plants appears to be superior in respect to heath.”The EU bans are political. I don’t know how else to say this.",

         "Absolutely organic means of production can easily supply enough food to support not only current population but many many more people too.Hunger has very little to do with lack of supply in Today\\u2019s World. Usually it is a symptom of poverty or war. There is food available but some just can\\u2019t get to the food because they either can\\u2019t afford it or there are people with guns in the way blocking access.Organic production solves some of these problems because generally it takes more labor to produce high quality organic produce. Not always but quite often. More labor means jobs for those poor who can\\u2019t afford food. Furthermore not only do they gain jobs, the farmer always takes their personal food off the top before selling the excess as a cash crop. So these will be well fed poor rather than starving poor.But the majority of the problem is due to agriculture purposely being wasteful in the industrial models of production.\\In reality organic production models properly integrated with animals and crops in symbiosis would cause an explosion of high quality food worldwide. None need be starving. But organic production would not be able to supply some of the purposely wasteful industries industrial ag currently supplies now. For example currently the U.S. produces 14 billion + U.S. liquid gallons of ethanol fuel. This is primarily made from excess corn production beyond what is possible for every man woman and child in the world to ever eat. Organic production models don\\u2019t need to purposely produce extra corn so as to purposely waste it making fuels that nobody wants anyway. It is ridiculously inefficient anyway. But it was designed that way on purpose. Simply a way for industry to purposely make money off inefficiency. It would all collapse tomorrow without multiple billions and billions in government subsidies paid for by you and me propping it up.Now instead of growing corn to make ethanol fuel additives, we allowed the great tallgrass prairies to return and raised our food on that instead? Huge increases in primary productivity so large that even taking a smaller % would still easily beat the industrial production models hands down. In fact the current subsidized production models are so inefficient, making that change would still even allow ethanol production off the excess grass! Strange as it may sound, ethanol production is so inefficient and takes so much energy to produce, even a smaller amount of grass produced ethanol would have by far more net gain in energy!Grass Makes Better Ethanol than Corn DoesAnd we know full well grass makes better beef! (If you are old enough to remember beef before feedlots) Not only just more better tasting beef per acre, but more nutritional as well.(unfortunately looks like hackers took down my best reference for health benefits, but luckily I have already posted most in long form on another Quora answer. So while all these Chico University links are now broken, you can find the citations the hard way)That leaves room for a return of wildlife as well!Grassland Birds: Fostering Habitats Using Rotational GrazingSo not only can organic feed more people, it can also rescue starving wildlife from extinction!But wait! \\u2026.. There\\u2019s more!Not only can organic production feed people better, provide jobs for the poor, make biofuels better, feed animals better and help wildlife better; it is also possible to mitigate man made global warming (AGW) too!Farming a climate change solutionCan we reverse global warming?In conclusion there is no reason preventing change to organic production systems worldwide excepting to feed the profits of a parasitic elite class that profit off the suffering of others. The big boys don\\u2019t want the change and are doing everything in their power to prevent it. Why? Because they are not clever enough to profit from economies of abundance, having made all their profits from economies of scarcity. They are just not smart enough. Sorry but it is truth. Most the so called elites are really quite stupid, but have managed to rig the system in such a way as to stay on top by economic brute force and ignorance.\\u201cI am an organic farmer. I am not afraid of change. I am the change.\\u201d",

The difference is that, Monsanto's test duration was merely 90 days, whereas Seralini study kept the experiment going for Two years.\nThis is the Seralini team's official website:GMO SeraliniHere is where they answer all criticism:Critics answeredLong story short, the French GMO study which linked GMOs to cancer in rats is valid, solid, and not 'debunked' as so many corporate outlets in USA claim - some of which immediately proceeded to 'debunk' the study even without one week passing from its publication.This example should illustrate what kind of political games and profits hang around the concept of GMOs.You can see what kind of pressure corporations have their governments exert from below example:EU dropped plans for safer pesticides after pressure from USYou can guess that it is no different in the case of GMO studies around the world.And yes, GMOs are banned in many countries:Twenty-Six Countries Ban GMOs—Why Won’t the US?The article asks, why doesn't US ban GMOs...The reason is simple and is a two word phrase: Monsanto Corporation.This is a massive corporation which does exorbitant profits based on GMOs. Incidentally, they are also the inventors and producers of Agent Orange chemical weapon, which USA used in Vietnam. And Aspartame artificial sweetener , which was linked to cancer itself.Aspartame controversyNow, the reason why such stuff are 'controversial' is solely because these corporations spend massive funds in order to do propaganda for their benefit. Like how they declared they were going to spend advertising money to combat 'global warming propaganda', and thus made global warming a 'controversial issue' in USA - not the rest of the world, or how energy saving light bulbs have become a 'cancerous, dangerous technology' in USA with same kind of advertising spending - to the extent that there is a strong segment of americans who think that incandescent lightbulbs are 'freedom' and they are 'safe'. While they pay ~70% more for the lighting they are using with incandescent bulbs.............GMOs actually pose a far greater danger than cancer risk or other health risks to individuals:Once a modified organism gets out into the wild and succeeds in reproducing, you can never take it back. Consider it like a virus.And you can never expect what the effects of such a rogue GMO will be in the wild in the broader ecosystems - on insects, other plants, and bigger animals and eventually entire ecosystems.To understand how big ecosystem damage can be, consider the case of big snakes (pythons) which had been released into the wild by pet owners from Florida when they grew too big:Florida Python Invasion: ‘No Going Back’ As Snake Population Spirals Out Of ControlThey are a plague now, totally changing the ecosystem by their presence. What will it end up in, no one can tell.This is despite they are NOT a genetically modified creature - they are totally normal, but we cant even take them back.GMOs are much more virulent. They are modified to not be able to produce by themselves in the wild. However, they can crossbreed with other organisms of their own species, and therefore you can never tell when one of the strains that you were putting in the wild will succeed in breaking away and changing maybe entire wold with no way to turn it back.And the effects of the combinations of the modified genes with whichever non modified member of their species they mate and breed outside the lab, is not known, and due to insane number of probabilities which span variations and future generations, will never be known.There is a reason why environmental organizations set up a seed bank in Norway to protect original, unmodified versions of our fauna and flora.Svalbard Global Seed Vault",

         "I’ll keep it relatively brief.I think the idea has merit, but in practice, GMOs have become a way for big companies to make a lot of money by encouraging farmers to grow their patented products, which show optimal performance typically in a chemically-intensive growing environment. And, not coincidentally, those chemicals are also sold by the companies which sell the patented seeds. Sure, that doesn’t describe all GMOs, but it does describe many. Feel free to peruse the approved varieties listed below.GM Approval Database- ISAAA.orgPeople will argue that GMOs are the answer to meeting food production demands for a growing global population. They say that current methods without GMOs won’t satisfy that demand after a point. I don’t think this is the right way to solve that problem — its like coming up with a drug to deal with the side-effects of another drug, but ignoring the original cause.What’s really going on is a degradation of soil as a natural resource as a result of conventional agriculture. Throwing more intensive conventional agriculture at the problem to circumvent the lowered output of a degraded resource will only further degrade that resource over time. The better answer would be to seek to replenish that resource — to rebuild soil. And the better way to do that is through no-till agriculture which integrates pastured livestock management and crop rotation.Here is a relatively short video of Gabe Brown giving a TedTalk on no-till agriculture.If you have the time for a much longer talk, which includes comparison of soil composition and testing, yields, water usage, etc., you’ll find others by searching on YouTube.no-till farming gabe brownBecause of the amount of information presented, these are considerably longer.These are real farmers using systems that rely less or not at all on costly chemical inputs — including fertilizer. Their production has gone up, and by integrating several revenue streams into their farming, they are able to get a lot more from their land than if they adopted conventional repeat-monocropping with chemical additions and patented seed. And while they’re at it, they’re rebuilding soil and sequestering carbon. To me, this is a better path than tweaking crops to be able to grow after being sprayed with herbicides.I’m not against all GMOs at all. I think there is much good that can come of this tool — the GMO virus-resistant papaya comes to mind, which can be grown where Papaya Ringspot Virus is prevalent and would otherwise make raising this crop impossible. So before anyone replies to this answer with “GMOs are safe” or “you’re anti-science” please just don’t bother. That’s not what my angst against some of them (i.e. herbicide-resistant crops) is about. I just don’t think they’re all they’re hyped to be, nor are they the solution I’d prefer. We don’t need to tweak crops to produce better in degraded soil — we need to replenish the soil.ETA — I keep trying to copy the video URL to start at the beginning, but it doesn’t seem to be working. So if you click the videos, just drag it back to the beginning.",

Some GMO plants are naturally resistant to pests, which allows farmers to use less pesticides.Some GMO plants have greater nutritional value than non-GMO plants. Golden rice (Golden rice - Wikipedia) is an example. Up to 2 million people every year die from vitamin A deficiency and another 500,000 go blind each year. Golden rice contains vitamin A precursors, and could virtually solve this problem.Humans have been selectively breeding plants since farming began. GMO is the logical extension of this.I do the grocery shopping in my family, and I try to watch for foods that are labeled “Non-GMO”, and then I don’t buy them. GMO products are safe and have the potential to greatly reduce world hunger, make food safer and more nutritious, and prevent some crops from being wiped out.I know this will not be a popular opinion with the conspiracy theory crowd, but in my view people who avoid GMO products do so out of fear of what they don’t understand. Given a choice, I always buy GMO.",

         "Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \\more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.  If you want to make a change, do it with your wallet.Also, please keep in mind that most GMO crops are grown as feed for livestock.  So you must keep meat and dairy choices in mind when shopping, as well.",

         "You can take this question in one of two ways.  If you want to answer the question \\proactively label their GMO-containing foods?\\Justin Ma has a great answer.  I take the question to mean \\regulations that require them to label food that contains GMO-derived ingredients?\\I will focus on the United States, since that is where I am most familiar with the regulatory environment. Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \\The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do. Basically, the people who just claim that mandatory labeling laws would just \\For those who insist on providing information to consumers, there is a way you can do this: label your own products the way you want, and don't force others to do so.

         "Genetically Modified Organism. However what that means can be one of contention and you really need to ask who you are talking to. In many debates they are talking about intergenus genetic modification (of any process) especially those like Bt-Ready and Roundup-Ready. The anti-GMO debates tend to be mostly anti-Monsanto and focus on those types of modification.Some labeling laws have limited their scope to just this as well. Vermont's H.112 (Page on State) defines it as \\The organic standard is a bit more direct: \\Excluded methods. A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production. Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macroencapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology). Such methods do not include the use of traditional breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture.\\Code of Federal Regulations)Some researchers are trying to separate the terms and use other terms for what they do depending on whether they are doing their breeding outside taxonomic group or not. There are also some trying to argue the organic standard should take the difference in public opinion (breeding vs anti-monsanto) into account (see Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics, and the Future of Food: Pamela C.

         "The same exact reason people are opposed to lab-grown diamonds: because an industry that makes immense profits from “organic” food has spent billions of dollars waging an immense propaganda campaign to whip people who don’t know how to do their research into a frenzy targeted at their business rivals.You even see some of that propaganda being repeated right here in the answers to this question, by people who sincerely believe whatever they’re told they’re saying.There’s a great example of this right here in this answer thread, by Tomaž Vargazon. I’m not picking on him; I generally find his content well-written and well-researched. But in this case, his answer is filled with misinformation and urban legend.For example, a common urban legend is that Monsanto sued farmers for accidental contamination, pursuing anyone with even a few stray plants in their fields so aggressively they bankrupted them.This story was invented by one man, a farmer in Indiana named Vernon Hugh Bowman. He collected soybean seeds from a grain elevator, planted them, then sprayed them with glyphosate to kill the ones that were not GM. He then planted his entire field with them.He tried claiming “accidental contamination” when he was sued, spinning a yarn that not even a jury of his peers believed. (Hint, when more than 95% of the plants on your farm are the same strain, that’s no accident, LOL.) He was convicted by a jury of his peers, but the story he spun stuck.I used to believe this story myself, just like Tomaž. Then someone challenged me to the same challenge I am about to make to Tomaž, and anyone else weho believes it:Name the farmers sued for this.All court cases in the US are public. If this happened, there should be plenty of examples. Cite cases. Name someone. You won’t be able to do it.In fact, Monsanto sent out people free of charge to clean out accidental contamination from any farmer who reported it.As for the “dangers” of glyphosate:Moreover, the company hid internal studies that showed their key moneymaking herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) wasn’t as safe as advertised. It was linked to an increase of cancer risk with gross overexposure.No.The overall incidence of cancer amongst people exposed to glyphosate is lower (yes, seriously!) than baseline.Lower. Not higher. Yes, seriously.The UN “study” that listed glyphosate as a “suspected carcinogen” is widely ridiculed in medical and scientific communities.So, why does this happen?$$$ money $$$Whenever you have a huge amount of money on the line, you will have a huge amount of money available for propaganda.People like to say Monsanto was this huge megacorporation. Actually, no, when it existed, it was kind of a pipsqueak.Organic foods, on the other hand, are an immense, fat-profit business. Sales of organic foods are more than triple Monsanto’s revenues.Organic food is huge, with much fatter profits than conventional or GM food, and organic food makers have poured billions of dollars over the yearsinto anti-GM propaganda—propaganda that well-meaning, otherwise intelligent people accept because it matches their bisaes and fears.I come to this from the position of a person who once believed as Tomaž and others do: Monsanto was an evil giant megacorporation, GM companies patented foods and that was bad, they bullied small farmers, and so on and so on.I started questioning that narrative when I started asking specific questions:How big is the GM food industry? How big is the organic food industry? Which is bigger?What farmers did Monsanto bully, specifically? What were their names? What were the case numbers? What farmers “lost their farms” because of Monsanto? Who were they?If GM food is bad because of food patents, then why did the first food patents get issued in the 1800s, before genetic engineering was a thing? Why are organic foods patented? (Spoilter: Yes, organic and conventional foods are also patented! Surprise! It’s amazing how many people legitimately don’t know this.)Once you start down these rabbit holes, you end up in a very different place than you started from.Why are so many people opposed to GM food? Because people are fearful about food in general, people have a purity fetish around food, and a lot of extremely profitable corporations spend a ton of money to make people frightened of GM food.Add in anti-corporate narratives and it becomes an easy sell.",

         "No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \\Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.",

         "Well, it is a topic on which a long debate could be done on.As being a biotechnologist (pursing undergraduate course in biotech), my views are as follows:A variety of GM crops are being harvested in various parts of the world and many are still being worked on. The best part of GM crops is their high yield, good nutritional quality, a good shelf life, could be harvested in lesser time than the normal ones and the point of my interest- could be used to make edible vaccines (would'nt it be great- nutrition and vaccination all in a single shot- could be quite handy for poor countries and UN). Now on to the GM organisms. Till now, I have not known to any GMO. But I still know that they are being worked on. Their best use could be for MOLECULAR PHARMING (i.e obtaining vaccines and other biological agents like insulin from animal milk or any other by-product). Their are many GM Microorganisms, which are being used industrially in breweries and other pharmaceutical or I should say neutraceutical (nutritional + pharmaceutical) companies, and have revolutionized this sector.But the cons are bio-ethics. I am stating them below:These modifications are considered to be \\These modified organisms might get out of the control and breed with the wild/domestic species thereby causing Mutants or any other lethal organism like super-weeds.Often these genes are taken from virus sources, wich inturn might not be harmful at present condtion but might be in future.Ecological concerns ; these new species might overcome the existing ones and could cause harm to the ecological balance or could change the evolutionary pattern.Effect of GM crops on non-target species.The GM crops might change the fundamental vegetable nature of plants as the genes from animals are being used in crop plants. In simple words, plants would be no more remain vegetarian but would turn a non-vegetarian food. (Creepy!!! Isnt it?)\\n\\nBut my verdict is, if these GMOs and GMCs are the future. But they must be sold with a label \\",

         "Music.Music is what happens when a song is played -- either a performance or a recording of a performance. Music cannot be separated from the experience of listening to it in a way that can be owned.Recordings aren't even owned. They are licensed to you for limited uses by the copyright holders, in most cases, it'd the record label the artist has signed over their rights to.What we think of as the recordings we own on digital file, CD, phonograph, cassette, 8-track, or whatever -- these are merely containers for the recordings. We own the containers, but we do not own the recordings contained within them.It all boils down to this: what we think of as ownership of music is actually us paying for the right to access the music. In a world where the technological cost of providing global access to the entire history of recorded music is easily covered by charging a small fee or tax for access, the idea of music ownership will and should be considered anachronistic. Music is free. What we pay for is access.Of course, musicians need some sort of fair compensation to stimulate the production of music. This is the purpose of copyright in the first place. But musicians have never been fairly compensated for their music. Over the last few centuries, a microscopic minority of musicians became wealthy, while the music industry itself grew to a multibillion dollar enterprise. Increasingly, copyright is used by corporations to stifle technological innovation the maintain the status quo of musician exploitation and the lie of musical ownership. Prior to the invention of the recording, music could only be generated through a performance. There had to be musicians playing within earshot in order for one to experience music. Or, you had to play the song yourself. The economics were simple -- musicians enjoyed the support of their patrons, and later, the public became patron as live music flourished. The recording -- and the concept of music ownership -- shut down much of this burgeoning live music scene. The great irony is that after the recording dominated 20th century music, the 21st century brought the disruption of digital distribution, causing us to give new value the live performance and viewing the recording for what it really is -- a facsimile of a single performance. As such, we have a new generation of listeners and musicians that recognize music ownership is a capitalist illusion, access to music should be free like tap water (which we perceive as free but in reality is paid for as a utility), and live performance should be held up as the ultimate authentic music experience. This is why the concert industry is booming and record sales are plummeting.",

         "A genetically modified organism, is simply an organism who’s genes has been modified, as a result of human intervention by performing genetic engineering. This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is! And how/what’s that? We take the gene, that acts like a blueprint on how to make this hormone, from a healthy person. We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin. Soon, you have thousands of bacteria producing this hormone, and the quantity and quality of this insulin is good enough to become an economically viable manufacturing process, and that’s how you get insulin these days.So who was the GMO here? It was the bacteria. You manipulated the genetic material of the bacteria, so that it produced more insulin, which was for your own benefit, and made medicine cheaper.By the way, which kind of egg do you have?",

This runs so counter to the psuedo science out there that the common thing, if you say genetically modified crops are green, is to be accused of being a, er, plant. I'm pro green, pro science and it's lead me to knowing the concept of organic food being green and healthy and geneticially modified crops being ungreen and bad for the health, if anything, are backwards. Organic crops are often far from green to produce due to the resources needed to produce them. Organic meat, for example, has a much higher carbon footprint than non organic.

         "I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control. This is not product that is being sold to help American families.The link below was deleted by the magazine after sharing. Here is the backup.China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be Buying (deleted after sharing)China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be BuyingThe Snack Food and Corn Syrup Lobbyist Shaping Guidelines for AmericansIf you’re consuming mostly genetically modified organisms into your diet, it means that you are not cooking your food from scratch. Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day. That is pretty sad.",

         "Neither in my opinion. Is the farmer a knowledgeable and honest grower? That’s the question of importance.Organic means that it has been grown without the application of synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. However, this does not prohibit the farmer from applying natural pesticides (pyrethrines) at high concentrations too close to harvest or applying manure from animals that were given high doses of antibiotics.The responsibility of what is good or not lies with the farmer. Not the product.If you follow the instructions of how to properly grow a crop from an agronomist it does not matter, which method or seed you use; organic or conventional farming, non-gmo or gmo. There are no nutritional differences measured from either type of crop cultivation. Flavor-wise it is better to buy from a farmer’s market than a supermarket, where they harvest immature vegetables and fruits, but nutritionally they are almost identical as well.Non-GMOs means that the product has been produced through traditional breeding methods which is a very long procedure (10–15 years). GMOs could have a disease resistance or drought resistance gene inside them from a related species or not, etc. This has absolutely no effect on you, unless we are talking about a toxin introduced into the plant, which companies avoid anyway doing that. Companies do not want dead or ill consumers. They want hungry and healthy consumers to keep buying their products. Period.So, to answer your question:I would consider more important Organic vs non-organic, although there is no practical difference between them for you. I just expect that Organic farmers would be more diligent as small-scale farmers about their concern for your food. GMOs vs non-GMOs just does not matter.Personally I would choose the farmer first and then my products.",

         "Thanks for he A2A.\\n \\nI am uneasy about these answers here. Not that they are wrong, they're not. But they aren't telling the full story.\\n \\nLet's look at some common GMO crops. Corn. Soybeans. Cotton. Canola ( rapeseed). Alfalfa. There's more, but these will do fine for what we are talking about.\\n \\nNow we need to separate the crops into 2 subsets. Those crops that are self pollinated and those that are outcrossers. Selfers are plants that pollinate themselves by having the pollen drop into the stigma of the flower without needing outside help, like an insect or the wind, thus ensuring a tomato, or a chile pepper, or a wheat kernel. \\n \\n \\nOutcrossers need help to spread pollen. That head of broccoli needed mostly bees to help create it, or that ear of corn needed some strong wind to spread pollen.\\n \\nOk. So. Selfers- Soybeans. Cotton. \\n \\nOutcrossers.- Corn. Canola. Alfalfa. \\n \\nCrops that are selfers don't suffer from inbreeding depression, a term that means they lose their viability over time from having too little genetic diversity during the growing season. So saving seed from one tomato plant, one wheat plant, one bean plant is fine. That seed can be grown and resaved for a lifetime.\\n \\nOutcrossers aren't like that. They need lot's of genetic diversity, which to the farmer means they  grow a lot of plants. One broccoli plant? No way. One carrot plant, one corn plant, one canola plant? No. Think at least 500 to start, and no less than 100 to finish. They need pollination from a large population of plants. Without this, the seed is very poor, genetically bottlenecked and usually unfit for next generational use. \\n \\nOk?\\n \\nNow let's further separate these crops into 2 types. Open pollinated and hybrid. \\n \\nOP crops are old fashioned crops that our grandparents and parents grew, including heirloom varieties. If you grow, for example, an heirloom tomato, and decide to pull some seeds out of one of the tomatoes, it will \\hybrid vigor, and clearly outshines the parents. Note the term F1 on the seed packet.\\n \\nHowever , when you pull some seeds out of that hybrid tomato, and plant them the next year, they don't come true. What they do is revert to one of the parental lines, and \\",

         "I have trouble with the terminology, but the concepts are clear.GMO, or genetically modified organisms, are the essence of agriculture. For thousands of years, farmers, agronomists, plant scientists have used plant and animal breeding to manipulate the genetic makeup of the foods we eat. That is a good thing.However, GMOs as they are developed today, uses recombinant DNA manipulation to alter the attributes of the plants. As a result, it is possible to introduce changes that we would never see in nature (i.e. introduction of animal characteristics into plant material). While that’s not necessarily bad, we also greatly reduce the time it takes to see the changes in the material, and therefore we can’t fully investigate the unintended consequences of our manipulations. Every technological innovation has risks of unintended consequences, but genetic manipulation can have broad, catastrophic impacts. It’s kind of like nuclear power generation: it’s a great thing when everything is fine, and failure may be very rare, but the impacts can be huge. I advocate continuing research, but proceeding slowly. I also believe in detailed labelling to enable consumers to make their own choices.Organic foods fall into a different category. The term “organic” is meaningless and requires significant explanation in order to be useful for consumers. I do not believe that inorganic fertilizers are “bad” and I do not believe that all herbicides and pesticides are bad. Again, it’s a matter of really looking into the specific practices of cultivation. That’s one reason why I do agree with buying from local producers: the consumer has the ability to find out exactly how something was produced and to talk to the producer.",

In fact, there's a list: Studies with independent fundingThe conclusions are clear: no negative effects. GMO's are just as nutritious as non-GMO's (except when they are designed to be even more nutritious, like Golden Rice) and cause no health problems. Here is a literature review of these results, and another assessment of GE food safety here.Note that studies do exist saying GMO's are bad… but you asked for good ones. Studies existed saying vaccines cause autism and that cigarettes are harmless, but those studies were flawed and a few were retracted. It is important to 1) not let a single study trump the dozens of studies that contradict it, 2) not confuse opinion papers with actual science research, and 3) be sure that any study has valid controls, a large sample size, no conflict of interest (be it big-Agritech or big-Organic, both of which have millions to burn), and is otherwise scientifically sound. A study that tried to show GMO corn gives rats cancer, for example, was debunked when scientists pointed out they used cancer-prone rats in the study, who would have gotten sick even if they were fed organic food, or nothing at all.Ultimately, while political and economic opposition to GMO's may be valid, the science is clear that they are safe. Scientists are disappointed that anti-GMO activists, like anti-vaccine activists and climate change deniers, are twisting the facts or denying overwhelming evidence to lie to their constituency and get political points.",

         "Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \\more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.  If you want to make a change, do it with your wallet.Also, please keep in mind that most GMO crops are grown as feed for livestock.

         "You can take this question in one of two ways.  If you want to answer the question \\proactively label their GMO-containing foods?\\Justin Ma has a great answer.  I take the question to mean \\regulations that require them to label food that contains GMO-derived ingredients?\\I will focus on the United States, since that is where I am most familiar with the regulatory environment. Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \\The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do. Basically, the people who just claim that mandatory labeling laws would just \\For those who insist on providing information to consumers, there is a way you can do this: label your own products the way you want, and don't force others to do so.

         "Genetically Modified Organism. However what that means can be one of contention and you really need to ask who you are talking to. In many debates they are talking about intergenus genetic modification (of any process) especially those like Bt-Ready and Roundup-Ready. The anti-GMO debates tend to be mostly anti-Monsanto and focus on those types of modification.Some labeling laws have limited their scope to just this as well. Vermont's H.112 (Page on State) defines it as \\The organic standard is a bit more direct: \\Excluded methods. A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production. Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macroencapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology). Such methods do not include the use of traditional breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture.\\Code of Federal Regulations)Some researchers are trying to separate the terms and use other terms for what they do depending on whether they are doing their breeding outside taxonomic group or not. There are also some trying to argue the organic standard should take the difference in public opinion (breeding vs anti-monsanto) into account (see Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics, and the Future of Food: Pamela C.

         "The same exact reason people are opposed to lab-grown diamonds: because an industry that makes immense profits from “organic” food has spent billions of dollars waging an immense propaganda campaign to whip people who don’t know how to do their research into a frenzy targeted at their business rivals.You even see some of that propaganda being repeated right here in the answers to this question, by people who sincerely believe whatever they’re told they’re saying.There’s a great example of this right here in this answer thread, by Tomaž Vargazon. I’m not picking on him; I generally find his content well-written and well-researched. But in this case, his answer is filled with misinformation and urban legend.For example, a common urban legend is that Monsanto sued farmers for accidental contamination, pursuing anyone with even a few stray plants in their fields so aggressively they bankrupted them.This story was invented by one man, a farmer in Indiana named Vernon Hugh Bowman. He collected soybean seeds from a grain elevator, planted them, then sprayed them with glyphosate to kill the ones that were not GM. He then planted his entire field with them.He tried claiming “accidental contamination” when he was sued, spinning a yarn that not even a jury of his peers believed. (Hint, when more than 95% of the plants on your farm are the same strain, that’s no accident, LOL.) He was convicted by a jury of his peers, but the story he spun stuck.I used to believe this story myself, just like Tomaž. Then someone challenged me to the same challenge I am about to make to Tomaž, and anyone else weho believes it:Name the farmers sued for this.All court cases in the US are public. If this happened, there should be plenty of examples. Cite cases. Name someone. You won’t be able to do it.In fact, Monsanto sent out people free of charge to clean out accidental contamination from any farmer who reported it.As for the “dangers” of glyphosate:Moreover, the company hid internal studies that showed their key moneymaking herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) wasn’t as safe as advertised. It was linked to an increase of cancer risk with gross overexposure.No.The overall incidence of cancer amongst people exposed to glyphosate is lower (yes, seriously!) than baseline.Lower. Not higher. Yes, seriously.The UN “study” that listed glyphosate as a “suspected carcinogen” is widely ridiculed in medical and scientific communities.So, why does this happen?$$$ money $$$Whenever you have a huge amount of money on the line, you will have a huge amount of money available for propaganda.People like to say Monsanto was this huge megacorporation. Actually, no, when it existed, it was kind of a pipsqueak.Organic foods, on the other hand, are an immense, fat-profit business. Sales of organic foods are more than triple Monsanto’s revenues.Organic food is huge, with much fatter profits than conventional or GM food, and organic food makers have poured billions of dollars over the yearsinto anti-GM propaganda—propaganda that well-meaning, otherwise intelligent people accept because it matches their bisaes and fears.I come to this from the position of a person who once believed as Tomaž and others do: Monsanto was an evil giant megacorporation, GM companies patented foods and that was bad, they bullied small farmers, and so on and so on.I started questioning that narrative when I started asking specific questions:How big is the GM food industry? How big is the organic food industry? Which is bigger?What farmers did Monsanto bully, specifically? What were their names? What were the case numbers? What farmers “lost their farms” because of Monsanto? Who were they?If GM food is bad because of food patents, then why did the first food patents get issued in the 1800s, before genetic engineering was a thing? Why are organic foods patented? (Spoilter: Yes, organic and conventional foods are also patented! Surprise! It’s amazing how many people legitimately don’t know this.)Once you start down these rabbit holes, you end up in a very different place than you started from.Why are so many people opposed to GM food? Because people are fearful about food in general, people have a purity fetish around food, and a lot of extremely profitable corporations spend a ton of money to make people frightened of GM food.Add in anti-corporate narratives and it becomes an easy sell.",

         "No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \\Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.",

         "Music.Music is what happens when a song is played -- either a performance or a recording of a performance. Music cannot be separated from the experience of listening to it in a way that can be owned.Recordings aren't even owned. They are licensed to you for limited uses by the copyright holders, in most cases, it'd the record label the artist has signed over their rights to.What we think of as the recordings we own on digital file, CD, phonograph, cassette, 8-track, or whatever -- these are merely containers for the recordings. We own the containers, but we do not own the recordings contained within them.It all boils down to this: what we think of as ownership of music is actually us paying for the right to access the music. In a world where the technological cost of providing global access to the entire history of recorded music is easily covered by charging a small fee or tax for access, the idea of music ownership will and should be considered anachronistic. Music is free. What we pay for is access.Of course, musicians need some sort of fair compensation to stimulate the production of music. This is the purpose of copyright in the first place. But musicians have never been fairly compensated for their music. Over the last few centuries, a microscopic minority of musicians became wealthy, while the music industry itself grew to a multibillion dollar enterprise. Increasingly, copyright is used by corporations to stifle technological innovation the maintain the status quo of musician exploitation and the lie of musical ownership. Prior to the invention of the recording, music could only be generated through a performance. There had to be musicians playing within earshot in order for one to experience music. Or, you had to play the song yourself. The economics were simple -- musicians enjoyed the support of their patrons, and later, the public became patron as live music flourished. The recording -- and the concept of music ownership -- shut down much of this burgeoning live music scene. The great irony is that after the recording dominated 20th century music, the 21st century brought the disruption of digital distribution, causing us to give new value the live performance and viewing the recording for what it really is -- a facsimile of a single performance. As such, we have a new generation of listeners and musicians that recognize music ownership is a capitalist illusion, access to music should be free like tap water (which we perceive as free but in reality is paid for as a utility), and live performance should be held up as the ultimate authentic music experience. This is why the concert industry is booming and record sales are plummeting.",

There’s been a number of polls looking into this topic, and they usually find no or a weak association in terms of safety. One caveat is that this is looking at things on average; you can find a stronger association on the tails. The associations are the activists you hear about, but they are in the minority. There’s a weak association between politics and opinions on GMOs, but it’s really just “public” vs “scientists,” where the differences a huge.Americans And Scientists Agree More On Vaccines Than On Other Hot Button IssuesJayson Lusk does a lot of writing about this (including polling) and states the same thing.

         "A genetically modified organism, is simply an organism who’s genes has been modified, as a result of human intervention by performing genetic engineering. This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is! And how/what’s that? We take the gene, that acts like a blueprint on how to make this hormone, from a healthy person. We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin. Soon, you have thousands of bacteria producing this hormone, and the quantity and quality of this insulin is good enough to become an economically viable manufacturing process, and that’s how you get insulin these days.So who was the GMO here? It was the bacteria. You manipulated the genetic material of the bacteria, so that it produced more insulin, which was for your own benefit, and made medicine cheaper.By the way, which kind of egg do you have?",

I'm pro green, pro science and it's lead me to knowing the concept of organic food being green and healthy and geneticially modified crops being ungreen and bad for the health, if anything, are backwards.

         "I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control. This is not product that is being sold to help American families.The link below was deleted by the magazine after sharing. Here is the backup.China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be Buying (deleted after sharing)China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be BuyingThe Snack Food and Corn Syrup Lobbyist Shaping Guidelines for AmericansIf you’re consuming mostly genetically modified organisms into your diet, it means that you are not cooking your food from scratch. Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day. That is pretty sad.",

         "Neither in my opinion. Is the farmer a knowledgeable and honest grower? That’s the question of importance.Organic means that it has been grown without the application of synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. However, this does not prohibit the farmer from applying natural pesticides (pyrethrines) at high concentrations too close to harvest or applying manure from animals that were given high doses of antibiotics.The responsibility of what is good or not lies with the farmer. Not the product.If you follow the instructions of how to properly grow a crop from an agronomist it does not matter, which method or seed you use; organic or conventional farming, non-gmo or gmo. There are no nutritional differences measured from either type of crop cultivation. Flavor-wise it is better to buy from a farmer’s market than a supermarket, where they harvest immature vegetables and fruits, but nutritionally they are almost identical as well.Non-GMOs means that the product has been produced through traditional breeding methods which is a very long procedure (10–15 years). GMOs could have a disease resistance or drought resistance gene inside them from a related species or not, etc. This has absolutely no effect on you, unless we are talking about a toxin introduced into the plant, which companies avoid anyway doing that. Companies do not want dead or ill consumers. They want hungry and healthy consumers to keep buying their products. Period.So, to answer your question:I would consider more important Organic vs non-organic, although there is no practical difference between them for you. I just expect that Organic farmers would be more diligent as small-scale farmers about their concern for your food. GMOs vs non-GMOs just does not matter.Personally I would choose the farmer first and then my products.",

Soybeans. Cotton. Canola ( rapeseed). Alfalfa. There's more, but these will do fine for what we are talking about.\\n \\nNow we need to separate the crops into 2 subsets. Those crops that are self pollinated and those that are outcrossers. Selfers are plants that pollinate themselves by having the pollen drop into the stigma of the flower without needing outside help, like an insect or the wind, thus ensuring a tomato, or a chile pepper, or a wheat kernel. \\n \\n \\nOutcrossers need help to spread pollen. That head of broccoli needed mostly bees to help create it, or that ear of corn needed some strong wind to spread pollen.\\n \\nOk. So. Selfers- Soybeans. Cotton. \\n \\nOutcrossers.- Corn. Canola. Alfalfa. \\n \\nCrops that are selfers don't suffer from inbreeding depression, a term that means they lose their viability over time from having too little genetic diversity during the growing season. So saving seed from one tomato plant, one wheat plant, one bean plant is fine. That seed can be grown and resaved for a lifetime.\\n \\nOutcrossers aren't like that. They need lot's of genetic diversity, which to the farmer means they  grow a lot of plants. One broccoli plant? No way. One carrot plant, one corn plant, one canola plant? No. Think at least 500 to start, and no less than 100 to finish. They need pollination from a large population of plants. Without this, the seed is very poor, genetically bottlenecked and usually unfit for next generational use. \\n \\nOk?\\n \\nNow let's further separate these crops into 2 types. Open pollinated and hybrid. \\n \\nOP crops are old fashioned crops that our grandparents and parents grew, including heirloom varieties. If you grow, for example, an heirloom tomato, and decide to pull some seeds out of one of the tomatoes, it will \\hybrid vigor, and clearly outshines the parents.

         "I have trouble with the terminology, but the concepts are clear.GMO, or genetically modified organisms, are the essence of agriculture. For thousands of years, farmers, agronomists, plant scientists have used plant and animal breeding to manipulate the genetic makeup of the foods we eat. That is a good thing.However, GMOs as they are developed today, uses recombinant DNA manipulation to alter the attributes of the plants. As a result, it is possible to introduce changes that we would never see in nature (i.e. introduction of animal characteristics into plant material). While that’s not necessarily bad, we also greatly reduce the time it takes to see the changes in the material, and therefore we can’t fully investigate the unintended consequences of our manipulations. Every technological innovation has risks of unintended consequences, but genetic manipulation can have broad, catastrophic impacts. It’s kind of like nuclear power generation: it’s a great thing when everything is fine, and failure may be very rare, but the impacts can be huge. I advocate continuing research, but proceeding slowly. I also believe in detailed labelling to enable consumers to make their own choices.Organic foods fall into a different category. The term “organic” is meaningless and requires significant explanation in order to be useful for consumers. I do not believe that inorganic fertilizers are “bad” and I do not believe that all herbicides and pesticides are bad. Again, it’s a matter of really looking into the specific practices of cultivation. That’s one reason why I do agree with buying from local producers: the consumer has the ability to find out exactly how something was produced and to talk to the producer.",

Here is a literature review of these results, and another assessment of GE food safety here.Note that studies do exist saying GMO's are bad… but you asked for good ones. Studies existed saying vaccines cause autism and that cigarettes are harmless, but those studies were flawed and a few were retracted. It is important to 1) not let a single study trump the dozens of studies that contradict it, 2) not confuse opinion papers with actual science research, and 3) be sure that any study has valid controls, a large sample size, no conflict of interest (be it big-Agritech or big-Organic, both of which have millions to burn), and is otherwise scientifically sound.

         "The only proven health issues with GMOs are possible allergic reactions. But those occur with non GMO foods too. The health and environmental benefits of GMO foods are substantial: higher nutrition levels, fewer inputs(fertilizer and pesticides) higher yields, longer season, wider range of growing areas, etc. I wii cite a couple of real, not theoretical, examples.In the western US the Pink Bollworm (PBW) is a big threat to cotton. It only feeds on cotton and okra, a close relative. The adult moth lays eggs on the cotton boll (fruiting structure that holds the seed and lint fibers) When the eggs hatch the larva (worm) eats its way into the boll, heading for the seed, which holds the protein it needs to survive. The worm is vulnerable to chemical control for 2–3 days, then it is too far into the boll to kill. Once the worm reaches the seed the boll, and lint is ruined. Some growers try to time spraying by trapping and counting the moth flights, picking the peak times to spray. You can never get all of the worms or moths unless you spray every night, which is cost prohibitive and environmentally un sound. A recent GMO discovery has for the most part solved this problem. Plant breeders have found way to “inject” cotton with a bacteria, Bacillus Thuringensis, into cotton. The seed of that inoculated cotton actually has the bacteria in it, which spreads throughout the plant as it grows. The PBW hatches and feeds on any part of the plant and it ingests the BT, which causes the worm to die. As a result 6 to 10 pesticide applications are eliminated. That means the cotton growing regions use thousands of pounds less pesticides every season. Did I mention the Bacillus Thuringensis is certified Organic?Another example of GMO benefits is Golden Rice. Some islands in the West Pacific Rim have been growing rice for generations with low levels of micronutrients. Beta Carotene- the orange in carrots- is needed in the diets of children aged 6 months to 10 years for Vitamin A production, which is responsible for eye development and general health. A million children die each year due to vitamin deficiencies and 500,000 children lose their eyesight due to lack of Vitamin A. After nine years of research Golden Rice emerged. It has higher levels of Beta Carotene in the grain kernals, so much so that it has an orange-gold color. Two cups of Golden Rice a day provides all of the Beta Carotene needed to maintain good eyesight That’s why your Mom kept saying “Eat your carrots, you’ve never seen a blind rabbit have you?”Golden Rice production and distribution has has been hampered by some governments who delay its use or stop it with excessive regulation. BT cotton has been criticized as being “dangerous” or a product of “Frankenfarming.” But GMO agriculture can lessen fertilizer, pesticide, or even water use. Genetically Modified plants can provide more food that is more nutrient laden, stays fresh longer, and is easier to transport.American researcher Norman Borlaug was the father of the first Green Revolution in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. During that time the world’s population grew by 100%, but food production grew by 150%, proving the 1700s economist Malthus terribly wrong, and the 1900s ag economist Boserup thankfully right.

         "An important key to understanding why Europe and the United States have chosen to regulate identical technologies in such a dissimilar fashion has to do with recent changes in politics of risk regulation in Europe. From the 1960s through the mid 1980s, the regulation of health, safety and environmental risks was generally stricter in the United States than in Europe. Since the mid 1980s, the obverse has often been the case: a wide array of European consumer and environmental regulations, including those governing GMOs, are now more restrictive than in the United States. In a number of important respects, European regulatory politics and policies over the last fifteen years resemble those of the United States between the late 1960s and the mid 1980s. They are often politicized, highly contentious and characterized by a suspicion of science and a mistrust of both government and industry. By contrast, the US regulation of GMOs resembles the European regulatory style of the 1970s: regulators have worked cooperatively with industry and been supportive of technological innovation, while non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have enjoyed little access to the policy process.That was from a very comprehensive paper on the subject of why the EU regulates GMOs more than the U.S. In short it has more to to with politics and risk aversion than actual good science.Please read the full paper to understand this more fully. Please follow my link.The Regulation of GMOs in Europe and the United States: A Case-Study of Contemporary European Regulatory PoliticsIn other words, most GMO bans or regulations are politically motivated and have nothing to do with science.What do most of the world’s scientific organizations have to say about it, including European.AAASThe American Association for the Advancement of Science is an international non-profit organization and serves some 261 affiliated societies and academies of science.“The science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe”.AMAThe premier body of physicians in the United States.“There is no scientific justification for special labeling of genetically modified foods.Bioengineered foods have been consumed for close to 20 years, and during that time, no overt consequences on human health have been reported and/or substantiated in the peer-reviewed literature.”WHOThe World Health Organization (WHO) is the direction and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.“No effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of GM foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved.ECThe European Commission (EC) is the executive body of the European Union“The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs are no more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.”NASThe National Academy of Sciences is a non-profit organization in the United Staes. It is the premier scientific body of the United States.“To date more than 98 million acres of genetically modified crops have been grown worldwide. No evidence of human health problems associated with the ingestion of these crops or resulting food products have been identified.”The Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities is an umbrella organization for eight german academies of sciences and humanities.“In consuming food derived from GM plants approved in the EU and in the USA, the risk is in no way higher than in the consumption of food from conventionally grown plants. On the contrary, in some cases food from GM plants appears to be superior in respect to heath.”The EU bans are political. I don’t know how else to say this.",

         "Absolutely organic means of production can easily supply enough food to support not only current population but many many more people too.Hunger has very little to do with lack of supply in Today\\u2019s World. Usually it is a symptom of poverty or war. There is food available but some just can\\u2019t get to the food because they either can\\u2019t afford it or there are people with guns in the way blocking access.Organic production solves some of these problems because generally it takes more labor to produce high quality organic produce. Not always but quite often. More labor means jobs for those poor who can\\u2019t afford food. Furthermore not only do they gain jobs, the farmer always takes their personal food off the top before selling the excess as a cash crop. So these will be well fed poor rather than starving poor.But the majority of the problem is due to agriculture purposely being wasteful in the industrial models of production.\\In reality organic production models properly integrated with animals and crops in symbiosis would cause an explosion of high quality food worldwide. None need be starving. But organic production would not be able to supply some of the purposely wasteful industries industrial ag currently supplies now. For example currently the U.S. produces 14 billion + U.S. liquid gallons of ethanol fuel. This is primarily made from excess corn production beyond what is possible for every man woman and child in the world to ever eat. Organic production models don\\u2019t need to purposely produce extra corn so as to purposely waste it making fuels that nobody wants anyway. It is ridiculously inefficient anyway. But it was designed that way on purpose. Simply a way for industry to purposely make money off inefficiency. It would all collapse tomorrow without multiple billions and billions in government subsidies paid for by you and me propping it up.Now instead of growing corn to make ethanol fuel additives, we allowed the great tallgrass prairies to return and raised our food on that instead? Huge increases in primary productivity so large that even taking a smaller % would still easily beat the industrial production models hands down. In fact the current subsidized production models are so inefficient, making that change would still even allow ethanol production off the excess grass! Strange as it may sound, ethanol production is so inefficient and takes so much energy to produce, even a smaller amount of grass produced ethanol would have by far more net gain in energy!Grass Makes Better Ethanol than Corn DoesAnd we know full well grass makes better beef! (If you are old enough to remember beef before feedlots) Not only just more better tasting beef per acre, but more nutritional as well.(unfortunately looks like hackers took down my best reference for health benefits, but luckily I have already posted most in long form on another Quora answer. So while all these Chico University links are now broken, you can find the citations the hard way)That leaves room for a return of wildlife as well!Grassland Birds: Fostering Habitats Using Rotational GrazingSo not only can organic feed more people, it can also rescue starving wildlife from extinction!But wait! \\u2026.. There\\u2019s more!Not only can organic production feed people better, provide jobs for the poor, make biofuels better, feed animals better and help wildlife better; it is also possible to mitigate man made global warming (AGW) too!Farming a climate change solutionCan we reverse global warming?In conclusion there is no reason preventing change to organic production systems worldwide excepting to feed the profits of a parasitic elite class that profit off the suffering of others. The big boys don\\u2019t want the change and are doing everything in their power to prevent it. Why? Because they are not clever enough to profit from economies of abundance, having made all their profits from economies of scarcity. They are just not smart enough. Sorry but it is truth. Most the so called elites are really quite stupid, but have managed to rig the system in such a way as to stay on top by economic brute force and ignorance.\\u201cI am an organic farmer.

         "There are strong studies which linked GMOs to harmful effects, including cancer.This famous French study was first dropped from the journal due to pressure and lobbying from Monsanto corporation and other american interests, but when its researchers sued the journal in the court and won on grounds that the research and its data was scientifically solid and viable, it was republished by the very same journal that dropped it upon pressure, by court order.Page on the-scientist.comThis study - Seralini Study - basically repeated the exact experiment Monsanto corporation used to vouch for the safety of its GMOs. The difference is that, Monsanto's test duration was merely 90 days, whereas Seralini study kept the experiment going for Two years.\nThis is the Seralini team's official website:GMO SeraliniHere is where they answer all criticism:Critics answeredLong story short, the French GMO study which linked GMOs to cancer in rats is valid, solid, and not 'debunked' as so many corporate outlets in USA claim - some of which immediately proceeded to 'debunk' the study even without one week passing from its publication.This example should illustrate what kind of political games and profits hang around the concept of GMOs.You can see what kind of pressure corporations have their governments exert from below example:EU dropped plans for safer pesticides after pressure from USYou can guess that it is no different in the case of GMO studies around the world.And yes, GMOs are banned in many countries:Twenty-Six Countries Ban GMOs—Why Won’t the US?The article asks, why doesn't US ban GMOs...The reason is simple and is a two word phrase: Monsanto Corporation.This is a massive corporation which does exorbitant profits based on GMOs. Incidentally, they are also the inventors and producers of Agent Orange chemical weapon, which USA used in Vietnam. And Aspartame artificial sweetener , which was linked to cancer itself.Aspartame controversyNow, the reason why such stuff are 'controversial' is solely because these corporations spend massive funds in order to do propaganda for their benefit. Like how they declared they were going to spend advertising money to combat 'global warming propaganda', and thus made global warming a 'controversial issue' in USA - not the rest of the world, or how energy saving light bulbs have become a 'cancerous, dangerous technology' in USA with same kind of advertising spending - to the extent that there is a strong segment of americans who think that incandescent lightbulbs are 'freedom' and they are 'safe'. While they pay ~70% more for the lighting they are using with incandescent bulbs.............GMOs actually pose a far greater danger than cancer risk or other health risks to individuals:Once a modified organism gets out into the wild and succeeds in reproducing, you can never take it back. Consider it like a virus.And you can never expect what the effects of such a rogue GMO will be in the wild in the broader ecosystems - on insects, other plants, and bigger animals and eventually entire ecosystems.To understand how big ecosystem damage can be, consider the case of big snakes (pythons) which had been released into the wild by pet owners from Florida when they grew too big:Florida Python Invasion: ‘No Going Back’ As Snake Population Spirals Out Of ControlThey are a plague now, totally changing the ecosystem by their presence. What will it end up in, no one can tell.This is despite they are NOT a genetically modified creature - they are totally normal, but we cant even take them back.GMOs are much more virulent. They are modified to not be able to produce by themselves in the wild. However, they can crossbreed with other organisms of their own species, and therefore you can never tell when one of the strains that you were putting in the wild will succeed in breaking away and changing maybe entire wold with no way to turn it back.And the effects of the combinations of the modified genes with whichever non modified member of their species they mate and breed outside the lab, is not known, and due to insane number of probabilities which span variations and future generations, will never be known.There is a reason why environmental organizations set up a seed bank in Norway to protect original, unmodified versions of our fauna and flora.Svalbard Global Seed Vault",

         "I’ll keep it relatively brief.I think the idea has merit, but in practice, GMOs have become a way for big companies to make a lot of money by encouraging farmers to grow their patented products, which show optimal performance typically in a chemically-intensive growing environment. And, not coincidentally, those chemicals are also sold by the companies which sell the patented seeds. Sure, that doesn’t describe all GMOs, but it does describe many. Feel free to peruse the approved varieties listed below.GM Approval Database- ISAAA.orgPeople will argue that GMOs are the answer to meeting food production demands for a growing global population. They say that current methods without GMOs won’t satisfy that demand after a point. I don’t think this is the right way to solve that problem — its like coming up with a drug to deal with the side-effects of another drug, but ignoring the original cause.What’s really going on is a degradation of soil as a natural resource as a result of conventional agriculture. Throwing more intensive conventional agriculture at the problem to circumvent the lowered output of a degraded resource will only further degrade that resource over time. The better answer would be to seek to replenish that resource — to rebuild soil. And the better way to do that is through no-till agriculture which integrates pastured livestock management and crop rotation.Here is a relatively short video of Gabe Brown giving a TedTalk on no-till agriculture.If you have the time for a much longer talk, which includes comparison of soil composition and testing, yields, water usage, etc., you’ll find others by searching on YouTube.no-till farming gabe brownBecause of the amount of information presented, these are considerably longer.These are real farmers using systems that rely less or not at all on costly chemical inputs — including fertilizer. Their production has gone up, and by integrating several revenue streams into their farming, they are able to get a lot more from their land than if they adopted conventional repeat-monocropping with chemical additions and patented seed. And while they’re at it, they’re rebuilding soil and sequestering carbon. To me, this is a better path than tweaking crops to be able to grow after being sprayed with herbicides.I’m not against all GMOs at all. I think there is much good that can come of this tool — the GMO virus-resistant papaya comes to mind, which can be grown where Papaya Ringspot Virus is prevalent and would otherwise make raising this crop impossible. So before anyone replies to this answer with “GMOs are safe” or “you’re anti-science” please just don’t bother. That’s not what my angst against some of them (i.e. herbicide-resistant crops) is about. I just don’t think they’re all they’re hyped to be, nor are they the solution I’d prefer. We don’t need to tweak crops to produce better in degraded soil — we need to replenish the soil.ETA — I keep trying to copy the video URL to start at the beginning, but it doesn’t seem to be working. So if you click the videos, just drag it back to the beginning.",

         "Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \\more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.

Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \\The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do.

In many debates they are talking about intergenus genetic modification (of any process) especially those like Bt-Ready and Roundup-Ready. The anti-GMO debates tend to be mostly anti-Monsanto and focus on those types of modification.Some labeling laws have limited their scope to just this as well. Vermont's H.112 (Page on State) defines it as \\The organic standard is a bit more direct: \\Excluded methods. A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production. Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macroencapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology). Such methods do not include the use of traditional breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture.\\Code of Federal Regulations)Some researchers are trying to separate the terms and use other terms for what they do depending on whether they are doing their breeding outside taxonomic group or not. There are also some trying to argue the organic standard should take the difference in public opinion (breeding vs anti-monsanto) into account (see Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics, and the Future of Food: Pamela C.

I’m not picking on him; I generally find his content well-written and well-researched. But in this case, his answer is filled with misinformation and urban legend.For example, a common urban legend is that Monsanto sued farmers for accidental contamination, pursuing anyone with even a few stray plants in their fields so aggressively they bankrupted them.This story was invented by one man, a farmer in Indiana named Vernon Hugh Bowman. He collected soybean seeds from a grain elevator, planted them, then sprayed them with glyphosate to kill the ones that were not GM. He then planted his entire field with them.He tried claiming “accidental contamination” when he was sued, spinning a yarn that not even a jury of his peers believed. (Hint, when more than 95% of the plants on your farm are the same strain, that’s no accident, LOL.) He was convicted by a jury of his peers, but the story he spun stuck.I used to believe this story myself, just like Tomaž. Then someone challenged me to the same challenge I am about to make to Tomaž, and anyone else weho believes it:Name the farmers sued for this.All court cases in the US are public. If this happened, there should be plenty of examples. Cite cases. Name someone. You won’t be able to do it.In fact, Monsanto sent out people free of charge to clean out accidental contamination from any farmer who reported it.As for the “dangers” of glyphosate:Moreover, the company hid internal studies that showed their key moneymaking herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) wasn’t as safe as advertised. It was linked to an increase of cancer risk with gross overexposure.No.The overall incidence of cancer amongst people exposed to glyphosate is lower (yes, seriously!) than baseline.Lower. Not higher. Yes, seriously.The UN “study” that listed glyphosate as a “suspected carcinogen” is widely ridiculed in medical and scientific communities.So, why does this happen?$$$ money $$$Whenever you have a huge amount of money on the line, you will have a huge amount of money available for propaganda.People like to say Monsanto was this huge megacorporation. Actually, no, when it existed, it was kind of a pipsqueak.Organic foods, on the other hand, are an immense, fat-profit business. Sales of organic foods are more than triple Monsanto’s revenues.Organic food is huge, with much fatter profits than conventional or GM food, and organic food makers have poured billions of dollars over the yearsinto anti-GM propaganda—propaganda that well-meaning, otherwise intelligent people accept because it matches their bisaes and fears.I come to this from the position of a person who once believed as Tomaž and others do: Monsanto was an evil giant megacorporation, GM companies patented foods and that was bad, they bullied small farmers, and so on and so on.I started questioning that narrative when I started asking specific questions:How big is the GM food industry? How big is the organic food industry? Which is bigger?What farmers did Monsanto bully, specifically? What were their names? What were the case numbers? What farmers “lost their farms” because of Monsanto? Who were they?If GM food is bad because of food patents, then why did the first food patents get issued in the 1800s, before genetic engineering was a thing? Why are organic foods patented? (Spoilter: Yes, organic and conventional foods are also patented! Surprise! It’s amazing how many people legitimately don’t know this.)Once you start down these rabbit holes, you end up in a very different place than you started from.Why are so many people opposed to GM food? Because people are fearful about food in general, people have a purity fetish around food, and a lot of extremely profitable corporations spend a ton of money to make people frightened of GM food.Add in anti-corporate narratives and it becomes an easy sell.",

         "No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \\Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen.",

The best part of GM crops is their high yield, good nutritional quality, a good shelf life, could be harvested in lesser time than the normal ones and the point of my interest- could be used to make edible vaccines (would'nt it be great- nutrition and vaccination all in a single shot- could be quite handy for poor countries and UN). Now on to the GM organisms. Till now, I have not known to any GMO. But I still know that they are being worked on. Their best use could be for MOLECULAR PHARMING (i.e obtaining vaccines and other biological agents like insulin from animal milk or any other by-product). Their are many GM Microorganisms, which are being used industrially in breweries and other pharmaceutical or I should say neutraceutical (nutritional + pharmaceutical) companies, and have revolutionized this sector.But the cons are bio-ethics.

In simple words, plants would be no more remain vegetarian but would turn a non-vegetarian food. (Creepy!!! Isnt it?)\\n\\nBut my verdict is, if these GMOs and GMCs are the future.

         "Music.Music is what happens when a song is played -- either a performance or a recording of a performance. Music cannot be separated from the experience of listening to it in a way that can be owned.Recordings aren't even owned. They are licensed to you for limited uses by the copyright holders, in most cases, it'd the record label the artist has signed over their rights to.What we think of as the recordings we own on digital file, CD, phonograph, cassette, 8-track, or whatever -- these are merely containers for the recordings. We own the containers, but we do not own the recordings contained within them.It all boils down to this: what we think of as ownership of music is actually us paying for the right to access the music. In a world where the technological cost of providing global access to the entire history of recorded music is easily covered by charging a small fee or tax for access, the idea of music ownership will and should be considered anachronistic. Music is free. What we pay for is access.Of course, musicians need some sort of fair compensation to stimulate the production of music. This is the purpose of copyright in the first place. But musicians have never been fairly compensated for their music. Over the last few centuries, a microscopic minority of musicians became wealthy, while the music industry itself grew to a multibillion dollar enterprise. Increasingly, copyright is used by corporations to stifle technological innovation the maintain the status quo of musician exploitation and the lie of musical ownership. Prior to the invention of the recording, music could only be generated through a performance. There had to be musicians playing within earshot in order for one to experience music. Or, you had to play the song yourself. The economics were simple -- musicians enjoyed the support of their patrons, and later, the public became patron as live music flourished. The recording -- and the concept of music ownership -- shut down much of this burgeoning live music scene. The great irony is that after the recording dominated 20th century music, the 21st century brought the disruption of digital distribution, causing us to give new value the live performance and viewing the recording for what it really is -- a facsimile of a single performance. As such, we have a new generation of listeners and musicians that recognize music ownership is a capitalist illusion, access to music should be free like tap water (which we perceive as free but in reality is paid for as a utility), and live performance should be held up as the ultimate authentic music experience. This is why the concert industry is booming and record sales are plummeting.",

         "A genetically modified organism, is simply an organism who’s genes has been modified, as a result of human intervention by performing genetic engineering. This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is! And how/what’s that? We take the gene, that acts like a blueprint on how to make this hormone, from a healthy person. We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin. Soon, you have thousands of bacteria producing this hormone, and the quantity and quality of this insulin is good enough to become an economically viable manufacturing process, and that’s how you get insulin these days.So who was the GMO here? It was the bacteria. You manipulated the genetic material of the bacteria, so that it produced more insulin, which was for your own benefit, and made medicine cheaper.By the way, which kind of egg do you have?",

         "I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control. This is not product that is being sold to help American families.The link below was deleted by the magazine after sharing. Here is the backup.China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be Buying (deleted after sharing)China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be BuyingThe Snack Food and Corn Syrup Lobbyist Shaping Guidelines for AmericansIf you’re consuming mostly genetically modified organisms into your diet, it means that you are not cooking your food from scratch. Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day. That is pretty sad.",

         "Neither in my opinion. Is the farmer a knowledgeable and honest grower? That’s the question of importance.Organic means that it has been grown without the application of synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. However, this does not prohibit the farmer from applying natural pesticides (pyrethrines) at high concentrations too close to harvest or applying manure from animals that were given high doses of antibiotics.The responsibility of what is good or not lies with the farmer. Not the product.If you follow the instructions of how to properly grow a crop from an agronomist it does not matter, which method or seed you use; organic or conventional farming, non-gmo or gmo. There are no nutritional differences measured from either type of crop cultivation. Flavor-wise it is better to buy from a farmer’s market than a supermarket, where they harvest immature vegetables and fruits, but nutritionally they are almost identical as well.Non-GMOs means that the product has been produced through traditional breeding methods which is a very long procedure (10–15 years). GMOs could have a disease resistance or drought resistance gene inside them from a related species or not, etc. This has absolutely no effect on you, unless we are talking about a toxin introduced into the plant, which companies avoid anyway doing that. Companies do not want dead or ill consumers. They want hungry and healthy consumers to keep buying their products. Period.So, to answer your question:I would consider more important Organic vs non-organic, although there is no practical difference between them for you. I just expect that Organic farmers would be more diligent as small-scale farmers about their concern for your food. GMOs vs non-GMOs just does not matter.Personally I would choose the farmer first and then my products.",

Alfalfa. \\n \\nCrops that are selfers don't suffer from inbreeding depression, a term that means they lose their viability over time from having too little genetic diversity during the growing season. So saving seed from one tomato plant, one wheat plant, one bean plant is fine. That seed can be grown and resaved for a lifetime.\\n \\nOutcrossers aren't like that. They need lot's of genetic diversity, which to the farmer means they  grow a lot of plants. One broccoli plant? No way. One carrot plant, one corn plant, one canola plant? No. Think at least 500 to start, and no less than 100 to finish. They need pollination from a large population of plants. Without this, the seed is very poor, genetically bottlenecked and usually unfit for next generational use. \\n \\nOk?\\n \\nNow let's further separate these crops into 2 types. Open pollinated and hybrid. \\n \\nOP crops are old fashioned crops that our grandparents and parents grew, including heirloom varieties. If you grow, for example, an heirloom tomato, and decide to pull some seeds out of one of the tomatoes, it will \\hybrid vigor, and clearly outshines the parents. Note the term F1 on the seed packet.\\n \\nHowever , when you pull some seeds out of that hybrid tomato, and plant them the next year, they don't come true. What they do is revert to one of the parental lines, and \\",

         "I have trouble with the terminology, but the concepts are clear.GMO, or genetically modified organisms, are the essence of agriculture. For thousands of years, farmers, agronomists, plant scientists have used plant and animal breeding to manipulate the genetic makeup of the foods we eat. That is a good thing.However, GMOs as they are developed today, uses recombinant DNA manipulation to alter the attributes of the plants. As a result, it is possible to introduce changes that we would never see in nature (i.e. introduction of animal characteristics into plant material). While that’s not necessarily bad, we also greatly reduce the time it takes to see the changes in the material, and therefore we can’t fully investigate the unintended consequences of our manipulations. Every technological innovation has risks of unintended consequences, but genetic manipulation can have broad, catastrophic impacts. It’s kind of like nuclear power generation: it’s a great thing when everything is fine, and failure may be very rare, but the impacts can be huge. I advocate continuing research, but proceeding slowly. I also believe in detailed labelling to enable consumers to make their own choices.Organic foods fall into a different category. The term “organic” is meaningless and requires significant explanation in order to be useful for consumers. I do not believe that inorganic fertilizers are “bad” and I do not believe that all herbicides and pesticides are bad. Again, it’s a matter of really looking into the specific practices of cultivation. That’s one reason why I do agree with buying from local producers: the consumer has the ability to find out exactly how something was produced and to talk to the producer.",

In fact, there's a list: Studies with independent fundingThe conclusions are clear: no negative effects. GMO's are just as nutritious as non-GMO's (except when they are designed to be even more nutritious, like Golden Rice) and cause no health problems. Here is a literature review of these results, and another assessment of GE food safety here.Note that studies do exist saying GMO's are bad… but you asked for good ones. Studies existed saying vaccines cause autism and that cigarettes are harmless, but those studies were flawed and a few were retracted. It is important to 1) not let a single study trump the dozens of studies that contradict it, 2) not confuse opinion papers with actual science research, and 3) be sure that any study has valid controls, a large sample size, no conflict of interest (be it big-Agritech or big-Organic, both of which have millions to burn), and is otherwise scientifically sound. A study that tried to show GMO corn gives rats cancer, for example, was debunked when scientists pointed out they used cancer-prone rats in the study, who would have gotten sick even if they were fed organic food, or nothing at all.Ultimately, while political and economic opposition to GMO's may be valid, the science is clear that they are safe. Scientists are disappointed that anti-GMO activists, like anti-vaccine activists and climate change deniers, are twisting the facts or denying overwhelming evidence to lie to their constituency and get political points.",

There is no way to grow foods entirely without pesticides. Plants themselves make pesticides. The goal is to make the plant toxic so that nobody else will eat it (except maybe the requisite pollinator of seed-spreader). \\The good reasons revolve around trying to grow the plant in an environment close to the one it evolved in. This involves a whole ecosystem: other plants, natural predators, a lot more land per plant than industrial farming.

         "No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \\Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything.EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.

         "Are genetically modified foods harmful to human health in the long run? No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding.Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \\Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.

This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is!

We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin. Soon, you have thousands of bacteria producing this hormone, and the quantity and quality of this insulin is good enough to become an economically viable manufacturing process, and that’s how you get insulin these days.So who was the GMO here?

         "I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control.

Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life.

Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry.

         "Is there evidence that GMO foods are bad for you? I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods.

There are no nutritional differences measured from either type of crop cultivation. Flavor-wise it is better to buy from a farmer’s market than a supermarket, where they harvest immature vegetables and fruits, but nutritionally they are almost identical as well.Non-GMOs means that the product has been produced through traditional breeding methods which is a very long procedure (10–15 years). GMOs could have a disease resistance or drought resistance gene inside them from a related species or not, etc. This has absolutely no effect on you, unless we are talking about a toxin introduced into the plant, which companies avoid anyway doing that.

For thousands of years, farmers, agronomists, plant scientists have used plant and animal breeding to manipulate the genetic makeup of the foods we eat. That is a good thing.However, GMOs as they are developed today, uses recombinant DNA manipulation to alter the attributes of the plants. As a result, it is possible to introduce changes that we would never see in nature (i.e. introduction of animal characteristics into plant material). While that’s not necessarily bad, we also greatly reduce the time it takes to see the changes in the material, and therefore we can’t fully investigate the unintended consequences of our manipulations. Every technological innovation has risks of unintended consequences, but genetic manipulation can have broad, catastrophic impacts. It’s kind of like nuclear power generation: it’s a great thing when everything is fine, and failure may be very rare, but the impacts can be huge. I advocate continuing research, but proceeding slowly. I also believe in detailed labelling to enable consumers to make their own choices.Organic foods fall into a different category. The term “organic” is meaningless and requires significant explanation in order to be useful for consumers.

And it involves a lot of human labor, not easily mechanized, because mechanization works best in monocultures and the whole point is to avoid monoculture.That's actual organic farming: the term was coined for the organic farmer, who isn't a machine.The rest of \\So, to bury the lede: yes, that's exactly correct. \\But the real point is to stop committing the naturalistic fallacy.

The industrial versions of organic are slightly less destructive.

         "The only proven health issues with GMOs are possible allergic reactions. But those occur with non GMO foods too. The health and environmental benefits of GMO foods are substantial: higher nutrition levels, fewer inputs(fertilizer and pesticides) higher yields, longer season, wider range of growing areas, etc. I wii cite a couple of real, not theoretical, examples.In the western US the Pink Bollworm (PBW) is a big threat to cotton. It only feeds on cotton and okra, a close relative. The adult moth lays eggs on the cotton boll (fruiting structure that holds the seed and lint fibers) When the eggs hatch the larva (worm) eats its way into the boll, heading for the seed, which holds the protein it needs to survive. The worm is vulnerable to chemical control for 2–3 days, then it is too far into the boll to kill. Once the worm reaches the seed the boll, and lint is ruined. Some growers try to time spraying by trapping and counting the moth flights, picking the peak times to spray. You can never get all of the worms or moths unless you spray every night, which is cost prohibitive and environmentally un sound. A recent GMO discovery has for the most part solved this problem. Plant breeders have found way to “inject” cotton with a bacteria, Bacillus Thuringensis, into cotton. The seed of that inoculated cotton actually has the bacteria in it, which spreads throughout the plant as it grows. The PBW hatches and feeds on any part of the plant and it ingests the BT, which causes the worm to die. As a result 6 to 10 pesticide applications are eliminated. That means the cotton growing regions use thousands of pounds less pesticides every season. Did I mention the Bacillus Thuringensis is certified Organic?Another example of GMO benefits is Golden Rice. Some islands in the West Pacific Rim have been growing rice for generations with low levels of micronutrients. Beta Carotene- the orange in carrots- is needed in the diets of children aged 6 months to 10 years for Vitamin A production, which is responsible for eye development and general health. A million children die each year due to vitamin deficiencies and 500,000 children lose their eyesight due to lack of Vitamin A. After nine years of research Golden Rice emerged. It has higher levels of Beta Carotene in the grain kernals, so much so that it has an orange-gold color. Two cups of Golden Rice a day provides all of the Beta Carotene needed to maintain good eyesight That’s why your Mom kept saying “Eat your carrots, you’ve never seen a blind rabbit have you?”Golden Rice production and distribution has has been hampered by some governments who delay its use or stop it with excessive regulation. BT cotton has been criticized as being “dangerous” or a product of “Frankenfarming.” But GMO agriculture can lessen fertilizer, pesticide, or even water use. Genetically Modified plants can provide more food that is more nutrient laden, stays fresh longer, and is easier to transport.American researcher Norman Borlaug was the father of the first Green Revolution in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. During that time the world’s population grew by 100%, but food production grew by 150%, proving the 1700s economist Malthus terribly wrong, and the 1900s ag economist Boserup thankfully right.

None need be starving. But organic production would not be able to supply some of the purposely wasteful industries industrial ag currently supplies now.

The difference is that, Monsanto's test duration was merely 90 days, whereas Seralini study kept the experiment going for Two years.\nThis is the Seralini team's official website:GMO SeraliniHere is where they answer all criticism:Critics answeredLong story short, the French GMO study which linked GMOs to cancer in rats is valid, solid, and not 'debunked' as so many corporate outlets in USA claim - some of which immediately proceeded to 'debunk' the study even without one week passing from its publication.This example should illustrate what kind of political games and profits hang around the concept of GMOs.You can see what kind of pressure corporations have their governments exert from below example:EU dropped plans for safer pesticides after pressure from USYou can guess that it is no different in the case of GMO studies around the world.And yes, GMOs are banned in many countries:Twenty-Six Countries Ban GMOs—Why Won’t the US?The article asks, why doesn't US ban GMOs...The reason is simple and is a two word phrase: Monsanto Corporation.This is a massive corporation which does exorbitant profits based on GMOs.

         "Is GMO food really harmful to human health and banned in some developed countries like US? There are strong studies which linked GMOs to harmful effects, including cancer.This famous French study was first dropped from the journal due to pressure and lobbying from Monsanto corporation and other american interests, but when its researchers sued the journal in the court and won on grounds that the research and its data was scientifically solid and viable, it was republished by the very same journal that dropped it upon pressure, by court order.Page on the-scientist.comThis study - Seralini Study - basically repeated the exact experiment Monsanto corporation used to vouch for the safety of its GMOs. The difference is that, Monsanto's test duration was merely 90 days, whereas Seralini study kept the experiment going for Two years.\nThis is the Seralini team's official website:GMO SeraliniHere is where they answer all criticism:Critics answeredLong story short, the French GMO study which linked GMOs to cancer in rats is valid, solid, and not 'debunked' as so many corporate outlets in USA claim - some of which immediately proceeded to 'debunk' the study even without one week passing from its publication.This example should illustrate what kind of political games and profits hang around the concept of GMOs.You can see what kind of pressure corporations have their governments exert from below example:EU dropped plans for safer pesticides after pressure from USYou can guess that it is no different in the case of GMO studies around the world.And yes, GMOs are banned in many countries:Twenty-Six Countries Ban GMOs—Why Won’t the US?The article asks, why doesn't US ban GMOs...The reason is simple and is a two word phrase: Monsanto Corporation.This is a massive corporation which does exorbitant profits based on GMOs.

And, not coincidentally, those chemicals are also sold by the companies which sell the patented seeds. Sure, that doesn’t describe all GMOs, but it does describe many. Feel free to peruse the approved varieties listed below.GM Approval Database- ISAAA.orgPeople will argue that GMOs are the answer to meeting food production demands for a growing global population. They say that current methods without GMOs won’t satisfy that demand after a point. I don’t think this is the right way to solve that problem — its like coming up with a drug to deal with the side-effects of another drug, but ignoring the original cause.What’s really going on is a degradation of soil as a natural resource as a result of conventional agriculture. Throwing more intensive conventional agriculture at the problem to circumvent the lowered output of a degraded resource will only further degrade that resource over time. The better answer would be to seek to replenish that resource — to rebuild soil. And the better way to do that is through no-till agriculture which integrates pastured livestock management and crop rotation.Here is a relatively short video of Gabe Brown giving a TedTalk on no-till agriculture.If you have the time for a much longer talk, which includes comparison of soil composition and testing, yields, water usage, etc., you’ll find others by searching on YouTube.no-till farming gabe brownBecause of the amount of information presented, these are considerably longer.These are real farmers using systems that rely less or not at all on costly chemical inputs — including fertilizer.

And while they’re at it, they’re rebuilding soil and sequestering carbon. To me, this is a better path than tweaking crops to be able to grow after being sprayed with herbicides.I’m not against all GMOs at all. I think there is much good that can come of this tool — the GMO virus-resistant papaya comes to mind, which can be grown where Papaya Ringspot Virus is prevalent and would otherwise make raising this crop impossible. So before anyone replies to this answer with “GMOs are safe” or “you’re anti-science” please just don’t bother.

Such methods do not include the use of traditional breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture.\\Code of Federal Regulations)Some researchers are trying to separate the terms and use other terms for what they do depending on whether they are doing their breeding outside taxonomic group or not. There are also some trying to argue the organic standard should take the difference in public opinion (breeding vs anti-monsanto) into account (see Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics, and the Future of Food: Pamela C.

He collected soybean seeds from a grain elevator, planted them, then sprayed them with glyphosate to kill the ones that were not GM. He then planted his entire field with them.He tried claiming “accidental contamination” when he was sued, spinning a yarn that not even a jury of his peers believed.

He was convicted by a jury of his peers, but the story he spun stuck.I used to believe this story myself, just like Tomaž.

Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us?To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus.Now, before you violently react to the word \\Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously.Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime.The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome!So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.

         "A genetically modified organism, is simply an organism who’s genes has been modified, as a result of human intervention by performing genetic engineering. This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is! And how/what’s that? We take the gene, that acts like a blueprint on how to make this hormone, from a healthy person. We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin. Soon, you have thousands of bacteria producing this hormone, and the quantity and quality of this insulin is good enough to become an economically viable manufacturing process, and that’s how you get insulin these days.So who was the GMO here? It was the bacteria. You manipulated the genetic material of the bacteria, so that it produced more insulin, which was for your own benefit, and made medicine cheaper.By the way, which kind of egg do you have?",

         "What is a genetically modified organism (GMO)? A genetically modified organism, is simply an organism who’s genes has been modified, as a result of human intervention by performing genetic engineering. This is done to bring out certain desirable traits (that benefit mankind) or repress the bad ones. This usually leads to wide profits for us, and at the same time, helps mankind by the name of reducing prices of food, and sometimes even medicine.Say for example, take two crops A and B. While A is known for its nutrition, B is known for its taste. What you do, is you combine the best of the both worlds, by performing a cross-over between these two, after which you get a crop, say AB.You take the gene that causes B to taste so well, and you take the gene that causes A to taste such bad. After ‘deleting’ that gene of A, and incorporating that gene of B inside A, you get a new crop AB, which has the taste of B but the nutrition of A.This was just a simple explanation of what GMO is.To understand the true significance of GMO, take the case of diabetes. Now, a type of this disease occurs when your body cannot manipulate your blood glucose level due to shortage of a hormone called insulin. You somehow need to consume more insulin for you to maintain a safe level of blood glucose level right?One way is to make insulin artificially inside a lab, as a result of many chemical reactions. This is a huge resource intensive task, and costs millions, which means that at the end of the day, only rich people can afford to buy it. If only there was a cheaper way…There is! And how/what’s that? We take the gene, that acts like a blueprint on how to make this hormone, from a healthy person. We copy this gene from it, and using modern technology, you incorporate this copied gene inside a bacteria (E.coli). Bacteria, while producing its own sets of enzymes and other chemicals, produces insulin too. And when this bacteria multiplies, its children also possess the ability to produce insulin. Soon, you have thousands of bacteria producing this hormone, and the quantity and quality of this insulin is good enough to become an economically viable manufacturing process, and that’s how you get insulin these days.So who was the GMO here? It was the bacteria. You manipulated the genetic material of the bacteria, so that it produced more insulin, which was for your own benefit, and made medicine cheaper.By the way, which kind of egg do you have?"

The reduction of pesticides, increase of crop nutrition and the increase of resistance of crops and yield per field all sound like healthy and green things to me.

I'm pro green, pro science and it's lead me to knowing the concept of organic food being green and healthy and geneticially modified crops being ungreen and bad for the health, if anything, are backwards.

         "I would just say this about genetically modified organisms.Everything in our lives is genetically modified whether that is by nature or forced in a lab. Genetic modification is no different from nature. However, it’s what the genetic modification is doing which forms the opinion on whether it is good or bad.For example there are many modifications which are good. We saved starvation in parts of Asia by genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body. Peasants in East Asia were going blind until Ingo Potrykus’s breakthrough.How genetic modification can be used in a negative way. In cigarettes, tobacco companies genetically engineer their crops to contain four times more nicotine than they used to, to make up for loss sales making them more addictive. This is obviously something that is harmful to society. Now what about the foods we eat?The two main modifications of our foods are mainly happening to corn and soy. One modification known as the pesticide resisters allows a crop to accept more pesticide and insecticide without dying. If not the crop would die from glyphosate which is a known human carcinogen proven in court. It’s labeled as Roundup Ready, and these make up roughly 70% of the GMO food crops in America. The second category are called the pesticide producers, which is actually a crop that produces its own glyphosate. These crops cannot be washed off before they enter our food as the pesticide is embedded in the DNA themselves. You can argue about how dangerous that really is and it hasn’t been proven, but like it or not you are consuming glyphosate cells into your body when you are consuming the pesticide producers.The health effect don’t really matter and I won’t focus on something we can’t prove, so let’s focus on something we can prove. I would not be croaking if we were actually seeing any real benefit from doing this to these crops, but the fact is these modifications are not being utilized to benefit mankind. They are being used to increase profit into the hands of the pesticide corporations, taking ownership of seeds away from the family farmer so they can’t save their seeds anymore, and we are subsidizing unhealthy diets.If your diet consists of mostly soy and corn product, that means you have a diet rich in processed foods. The genetically engineered corn and soy exists as a byproduct of the ethanol mandate in gasoline. Big oil lobbied Congress to subsidize these crops, and the excess is thrown into our processed foods. That’s it. It has nothing to do with benefiting society, it has nothing to do with making the world healthier or curing or preventing diseases. It’s literally lining the pockets of corporate farmers, and how do I come to this conclusion? In the United States, 70% of farmers subsidies go to genetically modified corn, soy, and wheat. Not strawberries, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, salmon, beef, or any other foods that should belong to a healthy diet. Organic corn family farmers don’t have access to them either.Is it any wonder that glyphosate use in particular has increased so much? Farmers are told what seeds and pesticides to buy. In 1992 American farmers were using 13.9 million pounds of glyphosate. In 2016 farmers had used 287 million pounds of glyphosate. There are those who may say, well we have to use these kinds of chemicals or the crops would die and we would go hungry. You don’t want to starve the nation do you? Well that is simply not true, because again no one is going to starve by not eating soy or corn. Soy and corn contain little to no nutritional value for humans. It’s being dumped as surplus in our processed foods, and as a side benefit it can make a good preservative in lollipops.Cornstarch, corn oil, fructose, HFCS, maltodextrins, dextrose, dextrins, soy lecithin, soybean oil, partially hydrated soybeans, ect.We are not running out of room to grow food. Half of the food we grow is thrown away before it is even sold. This genetic modification model is a symptom of American excess. It’s not practiced to the extent that it is practiced here in any other part of the world. It has nothing to do with population. In fact, China has the largest amount of families who are organic farmers in the world. These American corn and soy farms have soil that is completely devoid of minerals and natural fertilizers. Yes these farms do require an incredible amount of chemical sprays, but we don’t have to grow out foods the way corn farmers do throughout the Midwest. There is simply no money to be made in genetically modifying kale or oranges, because we’re not mass producing them like we are the crops used in processed foods. The number one consumer of this product is not even for American people, it’s for export to other countries like China. China doesn’t actually need or consume corn. They buy our corn as a means to manipulate their currency when the price reaches bottom dollar, to keep American farms under the grips of their market control. This is not product that is being sold to help American families.The link below was deleted by the magazine after sharing. Here is the backup.China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be Buying (deleted after sharing)China Doesn’t Need Corn, Here’s Why They May Be BuyingThe Snack Food and Corn Syrup Lobbyist Shaping Guidelines for AmericansIf you’re consuming mostly genetically modified organisms into your diet, it means that you are not cooking your food from scratch. Again, why are we not genetically modifying our crops to have higher vitamin or antioxidants to reduce cancer among our population? All we have to do is follow the money trail. The argument for the current use of this technology is thrown out of the window. It doesn’t even make good animal feed as cattle should be eating grass to begin with. The only reason they eat corn is because we produce such a surplus we have nothing else to do with it, and it’s a good way to hide money. Farmers subsidies are a policy left over from the dust bowl era. The processed food industry would collapse overnight if we stopped all subsidies. Our government gives more handouts to Kelloggs than they do Goldman Sachs.I’d like to leave you with a great quote from President Calvin Coolidge, who vetoed the first corn and soy subsidies that were eventually passed by Hoover.“I do not believe that upon serious consideration the farmers of America would tolerate the precedent of a body of men chosen solely by one industry who, acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus. Such action would establish bureaucracy on such a scale as to dominate not only the economic life but the moral, social, and political future of our people.” - President Calvin Coolidge (February 25, 1927)As for me, I will continue to buy organically and locally grown foods, because that means I am supporting family farmers that continue to strive for healthy crops that are not deprived of the nutrients every human needs to live a healthy life. Our soils have become depleted, to the point where we need multi vitamins just to survive. Our fruits and vegetables because of mass farming thanks to Roundup genetic modification contain 20–40% less nutrients than they did just 30 years ago. Americans have to consume larger proportions to obtain the same nutrients and thus obesity is rising. By growing crops the way massive farming operations are growing them, we are starving the American people. It’s simply pure greed for China’s market share. Family farms are going under because we practice discriminatory subsidies that put money directly into the hands of the fast food industry. McDonald’s doesn’t even use beef tallow for their potato fries anymore. They switched to soy oil. Is that a simple coincidence this is happening? No it’s not. In the modern era only 20% of Americans cook from scratch every day. That is pretty sad.",

That’s the question of importance.Organic means that it has been grown without the application of synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. However, this does not prohibit the farmer from applying natural pesticides (pyrethrines) at high concentrations too close to harvest or applying manure from animals that were given high doses of antibiotics.The responsibility of what is good or not lies with the farmer. Not the product.If you follow the instructions of how to properly grow a crop from an agronomist it does not matter, which method or seed you use; organic or conventional farming, non-gmo or gmo. There are no nutritional differences measured from either type of crop cultivation. Flavor-wise it is better to buy from a farmer’s market than a supermarket, where they harvest immature vegetables and fruits, but nutritionally they are almost identical as well.Non-GMOs means that the product has been produced through traditional breeding methods which is a very long procedure (10–15 years). GMOs could have a disease resistance or drought resistance gene inside them from a related species or not, etc. This has absolutely no effect on you, unless we are talking about a toxin introduced into the plant, which companies avoid anyway doing that.

For thousands of years, farmers, agronomists, plant scientists have used plant and animal breeding to manipulate the genetic makeup of the foods we eat. That is a good thing.However, GMOs as they are developed today, uses recombinant DNA manipulation to alter the attributes of the plants. As a result, it is possible to introduce changes that we would never see in nature (i.e. introduction of animal characteristics into plant material). While that’s not necessarily bad, we also greatly reduce the time it takes to see the changes in the material, and therefore we can’t fully investigate the unintended consequences of our manipulations. Every technological innovation has risks of unintended consequences, but genetic manipulation can have broad, catastrophic impacts. It’s kind of like nuclear power generation: it’s a great thing when everything is fine, and failure may be very rare, but the impacts can be huge. I advocate continuing research, but proceeding slowly. I also believe in detailed labelling to enable consumers to make their own choices.Organic foods fall into a different category. The term “organic” is meaningless and requires significant explanation in order to be useful for consumers. I do not believe that inorganic fertilizers are “bad” and I do not believe that all herbicides and pesticides are bad. Again, it’s a matter of really looking into the specific practices of cultivation.

         "For those who support GMO, can anyone explain why people should choose GMO over non-GMO foods? Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \\more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.  If you want to make a change, do it with your wallet.Also, please keep in mind that most GMO crops are grown as feed for livestock.  So you must keep meat and dairy choices in mind when shopping, as well."

         "Why do food companies resist labeling food that is GMO? You can take this question in one of two ways.  If you want to answer the question \\proactively label their GMO-containing foods?\\Justin Ma has a great answer.  I take the question to mean \\regulations that require them to label food that contains GMO-derived ingredients?\\I will focus on the United States, since that is where I am most familiar with the regulatory environment. Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \\The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do. Basically, the people who just claim that mandatory labeling laws would just \\For those who insist on providing information to consumers, there is a way you can do this: label your own products the way you want, and don't force others to do so.

         "What does GMO stand for? Genetically Modified Organism. However what that means can be one of contention and you really need to ask who you are talking to. In many debates they are talking about intergenus genetic modification (of any process) especially those like Bt-Ready and Roundup-Ready. The anti-GMO debates tend to be mostly anti-Monsanto and focus on those types of modification.Some labeling laws have limited their scope to just this as well. Vermont's H.112 (Page on State) defines it as \\The organic standard is a bit more direct: \\Excluded methods. A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production. Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macroencapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology). Such methods do not include the use of traditional breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture.\\Code of Federal Regulations)Some researchers are trying to separate the terms and use other terms for what they do depending on whether they are doing their breeding outside taxonomic group or not. There are also some trying to argue the organic standard should take the difference in public opinion (breeding vs anti-monsanto) into account (see Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics, and the Future of Food: Pamela C.

         "For those who support GMO, can anyone explain why people should choose GMO over non-GMO foods? Dallin Bastain makes the appropriate argument that GMO's do not typically make \\more food.  Currently, GMO crops either contain pest-resistance genes (like BT toxin which poisons herbivorous insects) or an herbicide-resistance gene (like Round-up resistance genes).  These increase a farmer's ability to increase yields.  Some GMO varieties allow for growth in areas where the crop will not typically grow well.  Drought- and salt-resistant crops are being developed, for example.  All papaya grown in Hawaii have a transgenic resistance to the papaya ringspot virus and most (90%) native varieties of papaya could not be grown due to viral prevalence.  If GMO germplasm is used to increase farmer's yields and profits, then there is no obvious difference between GMO crops and traditional varieties.  That is the GMO promise: better yields and higher profits.  However, as consumers we must be vigilant in our support of farmers, as providers of our food security.  Spend time with your local farmers at farmer's markets or through your local farm organizations (4H, FFA, your local University Coop/Ag Extension).  Ask them if they grow GMO and, if they do, how much it changes their yields/profits.  Then, shop accordingly.  Because, honestly, in the current political climate the only power we have is as consumers.  Most, but not all, politicians give more credence to lobbyists from the Ag corporations that sell GMO seeds, while ignoring the views of single constituents.  If you want to make a change, do it with your wallet.Also, please keep in mind that most GMO crops are grown as feed for livestock.  So you must keep meat and dairy choices in mind when shopping, as well."

         "Why do food companies resist labeling food that is GMO? You can take this question in one of two ways.  If you want to answer the question \\proactively label their GMO-containing foods?\\Justin Ma has a great answer.  I take the question to mean \\regulations that require them to label food that contains GMO-derived ingredients?\\I will focus on the United States, since that is where I am most familiar with the regulatory environment. Think of why we label and what those labels generally mean.  Consumer product regulation, especially in the United States, is designed to warn consumers of proven harms.  The FDA, for example, requires pharmaceuticals, which are designed to directly interact with body chemistry, to provide important information on dosage and potential side effects.  Another great example is the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) which was empowered by 1986's Proposition 65 to label carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic substances, which is why so many products in the US have labels that say \\The point is that mandatory labeling in the US means that something is dangerous or harmful.  GMOs have never been proven to be harmful to humans, all activists' claims aside, so why do people push for their mandatory labeling?  I can think of three answers:\\nLabeling advocates believe that GMOs actually do cause harm, despite the poor scientific support for that position, and want to force the issue by bypassing the existing regulatory process because they believe it is deluded or corrupt.Labeling advocates, either due to their economic interest or sincerely held beliefs, cynically desire to take advantage of most people's instinctive assumption that a mandatory label means that a food product must contain something harmful.Labeling advocates naively believe that everyone is as educated as they are and can make informed decisions about GMOs if they are labeled.  This is often the position of people ambivalent about proposed regulations.Position (1) is at the very least honest, if wrong.  Position (2) is not only wrong but openly deceitful.  Position (3) is naive, because it assumes that most people have the same level of education on the issues that they do. Basically, the people who just claim that mandatory labeling laws would just \\For those who insist on providing information to consumers, there is a way you can do this: label your own products the way you want, and don't force others to do so.

         "What does GMO stand for? Genetically Modified Organism. However what that means can be one of contention and you really need to ask who you are talking to. In many debates they are talking about intergenus genetic modification (of any process) especially those like Bt-Ready and Roundup-Ready. The anti-GMO debates tend to be mostly anti-Monsanto and focus on those types of modification.Some labeling laws have limited their scope to just this as well. Vermont's H.112 (Page on State) defines it as \\The organic standard is a bit more direct: \\Excluded methods. A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production. Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macroencapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology). Such methods do not include the use of traditional breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture.\\Code of Federal Regulations)Some researchers are trying to separate the terms and use other terms for what they do depending on whether they are doing their breeding outside taxonomic group or not. There are also some trying to argue the organic standard should take the difference in public opinion (breeding vs anti-monsanto) into account (see Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics, and the Future of Food: Pamela C. Ronald, R. W. Adamchak: 9780195393576: Amazon.com: Books)"
